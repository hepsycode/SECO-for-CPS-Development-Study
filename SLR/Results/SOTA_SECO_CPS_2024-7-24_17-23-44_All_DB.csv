Collaborative embedded systems (CES) can be seen as an emerging new class of systems which, although individually designed and developed, can form collaborations at runtime. When embedded systems collaborate with each other, functions developed independently need to be integrated for performing evaluation of the resulting system in order to discover unwanted side-effects. Traditionally, early-stage validation and verification (V&V) of systems composed of collaborative subsystems is performed by function integration at design time. Simulation is used at this stage to verify system’s behaviour in a predefined set of test scenarios. In this paper we provide a survey of simulation methods and tools for the V&V of CES. In the context of one use case from the automotive domain (vehicle platooning) we present solutions (methods and tools) and challenges brought by evaluating vehicle collaboration using simulation.","Automotive, Collaborative embedded systems, Simulation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85075343514}>, <None, {eid: 85077108292}>, <None, {eid: 84886806876}>, <None, {eid: 85075367424}>, <None, {eid: 85075381818}>, <None, {eid: 85075379145}>, <None, {eid: 85075367575}>, <None, {eid: 85077107940}>, <None, {eid: 85075360926}>, <None, {eid: 84936849686}>, <Control based driving assistant functions’ test using recorded in field data, {eid: 84994041952}>, <Using power-hardware-in-the-loop experiments together with co-simulation for the holistic validation of cyber-physical energy systems, {eid: 85044401770}>, <Validation of the vehicle in the loop (Vil); a milestone for the simulation of driver assistance systems, {eid: 47849124528}>, <Accelerated simulated fault injection testing, {eid: 85040584307}>, <Prototyping automotive smart ecosystems, {eid: 85051232784}>, <(Do not) trust in ecosystems, {eid: 85072038581}>, <Simulator coupling for network fault injection testing, {eid: 85077105884, doi: 10.1109/EUROSIM.2016.160}>, <Using rigorous simulation to support ISO 26262 hazard analysis and risk assessment, {eid: 84961700429}>, <On the potential of optimized data exchange in distributed embedded simulation, {eid: 84969815929}>, <Universal simulation engine (Use): A model-independent library for discrete event simulation, {eid: 84937795638}>, <Incorporation of autosar in an embedded systems development process: A case study, {eid: 82955178202}>, <Multi-domain virtual prototyping in a systemc sil framework: A heating system case study, {eid: 84963650494}>, <Recent development and applications of sumo-simulation of urban mobility, {eid: 84886898423}>, <Feral–framework for simulator coupling on requirements and architecture level, {eid: 84893500676}>, <Microscopic traffic simulation using SUMO, {eid: 85060462223, doi: 10.1109/ITSC.2018.8569938}>, <Revisiting software ecosystems research: a longitudinal literature study, {eid: 84960154891}>, <Virtual prototyping of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84859970826}>, <A method for the reproduction of vehicle test drives for the simulation based evaluation of image processing algorithms, {eid: 78650507277}>, <Hardware-in-the-loop testing of computer vision based driver assistance systems, {eid: 79960821155}>, <Virtual test drive-provision of a consistent tool-set for d, h, s, v-in-the-loop, {eid: 84872102918}>, <Ultra-reliable communication in 5g wireless systems, {eid: 84988273520}>, <Goals of software vendors for partner ecosystems–a practitioner s view, {eid: 84875258258}>, <A lightweight multilevel markup language for connecting software requirements and simulations, {eid: 85068086717}>, <Networking and integration of active and passive safety systems, {eid: 83455243346}>, <The ns-3 network simulator, {eid: 84876045426}>, <A scenario-based assessment approach for automated driving by using time series classification of human-driving behaviour, {eid: 85010046706}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Cyber-physical systems engineering, {eid: 84960376882}>, <V2x simulation runtime infrastructure vsimrti: an assessment tool to design smart traffic management systems, {eid: 80052486886}>, <How has the health of software ecosystems been evaluated?: A systematic review, {eid: 85055550236}>, <Bidirectionally Coupled Network and Road Traffic Simulation for Improved IVC Analysis, {eid: 84891005070, doi: 10.1109/TMC.2010.133}>, <An overview of the OMNeT++ simulation environment, {eid: 84923272193}>, <None, {eid: 85013408461}>, <Study on integrated modeling methods toward co-simulation of cyber-physical system, {eid: 84870468135}>, <Semivirtual simulations for the evaluation of vision-based adas, {eid: 84905383306}>",,,Springer,,,2019-12-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85075396516

Services, in such applications, enable the emergence of multiple end-to-end cyber-physical scenarios, formed dynamically based on their demands, e.g., Disaster recovery systems. This calls for new distributed service composition models that integrate different CPS services from multiple application domains for a given purpose - CPS ecosystems. The in-Cloud availability of CPSs can significantly improve the development process of such ecosystems thanks to the global and rapid accessibility of CPS services in the Cloud. However, a major challenge in this context is the highly dynamic nature of CPS services, making service composition a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose to exploit the concept of models at runtime in order to create a dynamic middleware framework that allows efficient composition of CPS services in dynamic and on-demand CPS ecosystems. This is achieved by obtaining the runtime models of CPS services and synthesizing software mediators that translate the communications between individual CPS services residing in the Cloud. The in-Cloud availability of CPS services will facilitate the design of such a middleware framework, and processing and maintaining the runtime models.","Cloud, Cyber-physical systems, Ecosystems, Models at runtime, Service composition",,,,,,,,"<Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Challenges and research directions in medical cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84155167716}>, <A vision of cyber-physical cloud computing for smart networked systems, {eid: 84916604600}>, <Wsmx process mediation based on choreographies, {eid: 33745161533}>, <The role of models@run.

However, in the ecosystem of CPS, unauthorized or spoofed devices may danger or compromise the performance and security of the critical infrastructure. The unauthorized and spoofed devices may include tampered pieces of software or hardware components that can negatively impact CPS operations or collect vital CPS metrics from the network. Such devices can be outsider or insider threats trying to impersonate other real CPS devices via spoofing their legitimate identifications to gain access to systems, steal information, or spread malware. Device fingerprinting techniques are promising approaches to identify unauthorized or illegitimate devices. However, current fingerprinting solutions are not suitable as they disrupt critical real-time operations in CPS due to the nature of their extensive data analysis or too much overhead on the devices' computational resources. To address these concerns, in this work, we propose STOP-AND- FRISK (SF), a novel fingerprinting framework to identify CPS device classes and complement traditional security mechanisms in CPS. SF is based on a secure challenge/response mechanism that analyzes the behavior of the CPS devices at both the hardware and OS/kernel levels. Specifically, the proposed novel mechanism combines system and function call tracing techniques, signal processing, and hardware performance analysis to create specific device-class signatures. Then, the signatures are correlated against known behavioral ground-truth to identify the device types. To test the efficacy of SF extensively, we implemented a realistic testbed that included different classes of CPS devices with a variety of computing resources, architectures, and configurations. Our experimental results reveal an excellent rate on the CPS device-class identification. Finally, extensive performance analysis demonstrates that the use of SF yields minimal overhead on the CPS devices' computing resources.","correlation, Cyber-physical systems, device-class fingerprinting, function calls, hardware performance, system calls",,,,,,,,"<Advertising in the IoT era: Vision and challenges, {eid: 85048327185}>, <HealthGuard: A machine learning-based security framework for smart healthcare systems, {eid: 85077820439}>, <Aegis: A contextaware security framework for smart home systems, {eid: 85077820141}>, <Sensitive information tracking in commodity IoT, {eid: 85060373043}>, <Real-time analysis of privacy-(un)aware IoT applications, {eid: 85089418587}>, <Verifying Internet of Things safety and security in physical spaces, {eid: 85067055097}>, <None, {eid: 85028331250}>, <A system-level behavioral detection framework for compromised CPS devices: Smart-grid case, {eid: 85075632049}>, <Detection of compromised smart grid devices with machine learning and convolution techniques, {eid: 85051437042}>, <USB-watch: A dynamic hardware-assisted USB threat detection framework, {eid: 85077510460}>, <PoisonIvy: (In)secure practices of enterprise IoT systems in smart buildings, {eid: 85097129666}>, <None, {eid: 85101772846}>, <Mobile device fingerprinting considered harmful for risk-based authentication, {eid: 84959328280}>, <Device fingerprinting in wireless networks: Challenges and opportunities, {eid: 84962428742}>, <HEKA: A novel intrusion detection system for attacks to personal medical devices, {eid: 85090150631}>, <None, {eid: 85075640430}>, <None, {eid: 85075630404}>, <BPMN4CPS: A BPMN extension for modeling cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84983786898}>, <Whos in control of your control system?

The integration of Information and Communication Technologies with power grids fosters seamless data sharing between different SG entities, which supports effective and smart governance in terms of demand response management, frequency support, and voltage stabilization. Nonetheless, this integration opens up several security and privacy concerns, namely, electricity theft, power loss, battery exhaustion, infrastructure mapping, etc. These issues become even more important with the addition of distributed energy sources, e.g. electric vehicles (EVs), battery energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources, into the SGs. We present a framework based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) and BlockChain (BC) to address two challenging issues of EV-aided SG ecosystems, namely, privacy assurance and power security. We leverage the capabilities of SDN to handle the complex interactions between different subsystems of the SG. Furthermore, we also employ BC and smart contracts' properties to secure energy transactions and data communications. We design a secure and efficient mutual authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and BC for privacy preservation during smart energy trading. We also proposed a BC-based smart contract for effective Demand Response Management (DRM) during bidirectional energy transfer between EVs and SG. Finally, we present experimental evaluations to validate the proposed framework's performance. The results obtained demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. The mutual authentication protocol designed is not only secure against major attack vectors (namely, session key security, message integrity, anonymity, forward secrecy, and so on), but it is also cost-efficient in terms of communication and computational costs. Additionally, the SC designed assures power security and maintains an adequate balance between demand and supply.","Blockchain, electric vehicles, energy security, Ethereum, privacy, smart contract, smart grid",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85112717715}>, <Blockchain-enabled reliable osmotic computing for cloud of things: Applications and challenges, {eid: 85094135155}>, <Blockchain applications in smart grid-review and frameworks, {eid: 85069754734}>, <Energy crowdsourcing and peer-to-peer energy trading in blockchain-enabled smart grids, {eid: 85069469985}>, <Security and privacy in decentralized energy trading through multi-signatures, blockchain and anonymous messaging streams, {eid: 85051646466}>, <A blockchain-based smart grid: Towards sustainable local energy markets, {eid: 85027865079}>, <None, {eid: 85070277526}>, <RETRACTED: Prevailing and emerging cyber threats and security practices in IoT-enabled smart grids: A survey, {eid: 85062194071}>, <Blockchain mechanisms for IoT security, {eid: 85115025902}>, <Automated ethereum smart contract for block chain based smart home security, {eid: 85076459354}>, <None, {eid: 85081955456}>, <Secure and lightweight authentication scheme for smart metering infrastructure in smart grid, {eid: 85079005834}>, <Adaptive blockchain-based electric vehicle participation scheme in smart grid platform, {eid: 85046756899}>, <Charging guiding strategy for electric taxis based on consortium blockchain, {eid: 85073615471}>, <An optimal scheduling algorithm for hybrid EV charging scenario using consortium blockchains, {eid: 85054177305}>, <Enabling localized peer-to-peer electricity trading among plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using consortium blockchains, {eid: 85040057093}>, <A secure charging scheme for electric vehicles with smart communities in energy blockchain, {eid: 85053164220}>, <A decentralized system for green energy distribution in a smart grid, {eid: 85076203035}>, <Analysis of SDN applications for smart grid infrastructures, {eid: 85063262166}>, <Demand-response management using a fleet of electric vehicles: An opportunistic-SDN-based edge-cloud framework for smart grids, {eid: 85073339693}>, <Blockchain: Trends and future opportunities, {eid: 85077808082}>, <None, {eid: 85112706863}>, <Docschain: Blockchain-based IoT solution for verification of degree documents, {eid: 85085741696}>, <Towards privacy protection in smart grid, {eid: 84886601284}>, <A game of incentives: An efficient demand response mechanism using fleet of electric vehicles, {eid: 85061497381}>, <Secure anonymous key distribution scheme for smart grid, {eid: 84933567760}>, <Provably secure authenticated key agreement scheme for smart grid, {eid: 85046135567}>, <Lightweight anonymous key distribution scheme for smart grid using elliptic curve cryptography, {eid: 84988310659}>, <Lightweight authentication and key agreement for smart metering in smart energy networks, {eid: 85050178630, doi: 10.1109/TSG.2018.2857558}>, <None, {eid: 85090277249}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-08-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85104629911

In general, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things are the sensing and communication infrastructures for CPS. Currently, software-defined networking (SDN) have been used as the new networking architecture for typical WSNs and CPS. However, there are two unresolved problems for a software-defined CPS. First, a feasible systemic architecture is a must for software-defined CPS, which should provide a global virtualization management and closed-loop control between the cyber side and the physical side in a CPS. Second, the lifetime of a software-defined CPS scenario needs to be extended for critical applications. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a systematic virtual networking architecture to perform the global virtualization control and monitoring of a CPS, in which network functions virtualization (NFV) configuration and orchestration can be realized. Moreover, based on the proposed architecture, a novel lifetime extension scheme (NLES), is proposed for a software-defined CPS. To orchestrate the resource dynamically and efficiently, the instant programmability of an SDN and instant deployment capability of NFV are utilized to control the topology of node modes of a CPS. Then, a game theoretic topology decision approach is proposed to control the topology of the clustering and virtual network function deployment of sensors at run-time in a CPS. The experimental results show that NLES has longer lifetime compared to those of the traditional schemes.","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), game theory, lifetime extension, network function

An emerging software-defined networks (SDNs) technology further enabled to optimize the communication among Industrial IoT (IIoT) and CPS entities. Nonetheless, the communication on public channel among different IIoT entities in an SDN-enabled environment may be exposed to various security threats due to wireless and insecure communication channels. To counter these security challenges in the way of wider CPS or IIoT adoption, we propose a novel three-factor authenticated key exchange mechanism (SUSIC) for SDN-enabled IIoT ecosystem. The SUSIC enables a registered user to access real-time data from physical IIoT environment directly after having mutual authentication performed through SDN-enabled controller node. The scheme is proved to be secure under rigorous formal and informal security analysis. Moreover, the simulation results and performance evaluation signifies toward achieving a better tradeoff between security functionalities and computational overheads comparatively.","Authenticated key agreement, cyber-physical system (CPS), Industrial IoT (IIoT), industry 4.0, software defined network (SDN)",,,,,,,,"<A survey of honeypots and honeynets for Internet of Things, Industrial Internet of Things, and cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85113853582}>, <A key-agreement scheme for cyber–physical systems, {eid: 85118620567}>, <A survey on edge and edge-cloud computing assisted cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85104257858}>, <Software-defined security-by-contract for blockchain-enabled MUD-aware industrial IoT edge networks, {eid: 85107389183}>, <Differential privacy techniques for cyber physical systems: A survey, {eid: 85076792818}>, <Software-defined networking security for private data center networks and clouds: Vulnerabilities, attacks, countermeasures, and solutions, {eid: 85097539763}>, <On the design of blockchain-based access control scheme for software defined networks, {eid: 85091477230}>, <Authenticated key agreement scheme with user anonymity and untraceability for 5G-enabled softwarized industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85101195137}>, <Decentralized SDN control plane for a distributed cloud-edge infrastructure: A survey, {eid: 85099565770}>, <The origin and evolution of open programmable networks and SDN, {eid: 85101757949}>, <Distributed traffic engineering for multi-domain SDN without trust, {eid: 85103301689}>, <On the security of public key protocols, {eid: 0020720357}>, <Universally composable notions of key exchange and secure channels, {eid: 84947232363}>, <Examining smart-card security under the threat of power analysis attacks, {eid: 0036566408}>, <An anonymous device to device access control based on secure certificate for Internet of Medical Things systems, {eid: 85114404433}>, <An authentication protocol for future sensor networks, {eid: 85018326534}>, <None, {eid: 85172291238}>, <Cybersecurity for industrial control systems: A survey, {eid: 85075494185}>, <Software-defined networking in cyber-physical systems: A survey, {eid: 85019848470}>, <Security challenges and methods for protecting critical infrastructure cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85032911530}>, <A tutorial introduction to security and privacy for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85071575881}>, <A privacy protection user authentication and key agreement scheme tailored for the Internet of Things environment: PriAuth, {eid: 85041490208, doi: 10.1155/2017/5290579}>, <Secure distribution of protected content in information-centric networking, {eid: 85074825504}>, <A bilinear map pairing based authentication scheme for smart grid communications: Pauth, {eid: 85062862600}>, <A secure key agreement protocol for dynamic group, {eid: 85017225167}>, <Design of a secure password-based authentication scheme for M2M networks in IoT enabled cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85066989524}>, <B-DAC: A decentralized access control framework on northbound interface for securing SDN using blockchain, {eid: 85122384606}>, <An identity-based encryption method for SDN-enabled source routing systems, {eid: 85129282157, doi: 10.1155/2022/1942097}>, <LBSV: Lightweight blockchain security protocol for secure storage and communication in SDN-enabled IoV, {eid: 85127795995}>, <Chaotic map-based anonymous user authentication scheme with user biometrics and fuzzy extractor for crowdsourcing Internet of Things, {eid: 85054018028}>, <A lightweight authentication scheme for 6G-IoT enabled maritime transport system, {eid: 85122062648}>, <POSTER: Authenticated key-exchange protocol for heterogeneous CPS, {eid: 85049195819}>, <Secure signature-based authenticated key establishment scheme for future IoT applications, {eid: 85018510573}>, <A secure authentication scheme framework for mobile-sinks used in the Internet of Drones applications, {eid: 85082172086}>, <An enhanced and provably secure chaotic map-based authenticated key agreement in multi-server architecture, {eid: 85040341681}>, <None, {eid: 33947707918}>, <Rotating behind privacy: An improved lightweight authentication scheme for cloud-based IoT environment, {eid: 85111987577}>, <A lightweight privacy-preserving authentication protocol for VANETs, {eid: 85090896957, doi: 10.1109/JSYST.2020.2991168}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-09-15,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85153505118

Such devices, commonly called Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with sensing/actuation capabilities, are becoming capable of managing the complexity of communications over the Internet. Nevertheless, the IoT ecosystem is still fragmented due to the different used vertical solutions. This heterogeneity makes IoT devices/systems unable to communicate seamlessly, leading to limited cooperation and tightly coupled deployments. To deal with the interoperability issues in IoT, we propose, in this paper, a Cloud-based approach with a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) mechanism enabling the IoT devices to communicate using the Representational state transfer (REST) model: an approach that follows the Web of things (WoT) paradigm. In particular, the system makes the IoT devices' hosted resources (e.g., sensors and actuators) able to be steered using globally resolvable (over the Internet) Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) even when deployed behind Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls. The system we conceived requires only one public registered domain name to associate, for all the distributed IoT devices, sub-domains of the public one while using a clever routing mechanism. An online implementation of the testbed is provided to show the feasibility of the approach. Further, a performance evaluation of the system is reported to assess the resource usage of the solution.","cloud computing, cyber physical systems, Internet of Things, openstack, REST, Web of Things, web services",,,,,,,,"<Pervasive computing: Vision and challenges, {eid: 0035428427}>, <The Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <Internet of Everything, {eid: 85025089241, doi: 10.1155/2017/8035421}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <The emergence of intelligent enterprises: From CPS to CPSS, {eid: 77956341661}>, <Enabling IoT ecosystems through platform interoperability, {eid: 85010468529}>, <Internet of Things reference architectures, security and interoperability: A survey, {eid: 85057160902}>, <Cloud services composition through cloud patterns: A semantic-based approach, {eid: 84978062342}>, <From the Internet of Things to the Web of Things: Resource-oriented architecture and best practices, {eid: 79956368665}>, <A stack4thingsbased web of things architecture, {eid: 85099452630}>, <Why is the web loosely coupled?

Thanks to recent advances in ICT such things can be considered always interconnected also providing sensing and actuating facilities according to the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems models. Creating smart services that exploit such a complex infrastructure is a fundamental and current challenge. To this end, aim of this paper is the design and implementation of the Software Defined Cities approach: a Cloud-based infrastructure that, starting from the well known concept of Software Defined paradigms, is able to transform this complex ecosystem in a simple and ""programmable"" environment where municipalities, companies, scientists, and citizens can easily collaborate in developing innovative smart services.

However, the limited memory resources of mobile systems and virtualization's memory demanding feature post challenges on main memory. Fortunately, non-volatile random access memory(NVRAM) provides opportunities to solve the problem with its attractive features, such as high density, low standby power and so on. However, the long write latency of NVRAM may slow down the performance of write-intensive tasks. Time-critical tasks may end up with unbearable performance. In this paper, we therefore focus on improving the performance of mobile virtualization with NVRAM/DRAM hybrid main memory. To achieve this, we propose NV-CFS, an user-centric virtual machine scheduler built for the ARM/KVM hypervisor. Experimental results based on various pseudo-randomly selected task sets show that NV-CFS can improve the performance more than 30%, and significantly reduce the task deadline miss ratio when compared to the traditional scheduling algorithm.","Hybrid main memory, KVM, Mobile virtualization, NVRAM, Scheduling",,,,,,,,"<Task allocation on nonvolatile-memory-based hybrid main memory, {eid: 84880076974}>, <Balloonfish: Utilizing morphable resistive memory in mobile virtualization, {eid: 84926443109}>, <Improving performance and lifetime of drampcm hybrid main memory through a proactive page allocation strategy, {eid: 84926484873}>, <Application-specific wear leveling for extending lifetime of phase change memory in embedded systems, {eid: 84907457538}>, <Wear-leveling for pcm main memory on embedded system via page management and process scheduling, {eid: 84908626170}>, <Energy efficient real-time task scheduling for embedded systems with hybrid main memory, {eid: 84908626165}>, <CFS optimizations to kvm threads on multi-core environment, {eid: 77949617282}>, <Cells: A virtual mobile smartphone architecture, {eid: 82655162792}>, <Performance tuning towards a kvm-based low latency virtualization system, {eid: 79951644894}>, <Kvm: The linux virtual machine monitor, {eid: 54049158076}>, <Improving performance and lifetime of drampcm hybrid main memory through a proactive page allocation strategy, {eid: 84926484873}>, <Phase change memory: A new memory enables new memory usage models, {eid: 70349996117}>, <An empirical comparison of global, partitioned, and clustered multiprocessor edf schedulers, {eid: 79951790068}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2015-08-24,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84961763047

Analytics software and scalable platforms are required to evaluate the data distributed all over the internet. But with distributed applications and large data sets to be handled, the network becomes a bottleneck. Therefore, in this work, we present an approach to automatically improve the deployment of such applications regarding the placement of data processing components dependent on the data flow of the application.

Predictions are that, by 2020 the connectable assets will generate about 44 ZB of data, which pose interesting challenges related to privacy, connectivity, scalability and others. A current line of action is the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which can be monitored and controlled by private clouds or edge systems. Our approach is to bring functionalities, such as analytics, as close to the devices as possible (denoted as Fog Computing) to reduce latency and enhance data privacy and communication robustness. As a starting point we're extending a standard-compliant Machine- To-Machine Communication (M2M) architecture with containerbased orchestration mechanisms to enable CPSs to be programmable, autonomous and to communicate peer-To-peer. As the main field of application we are considering in particular smart factory environments and Industrial Internet domains in general.","Fog computing, IIRA, M2M, ONEM2M, RAMI",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84899006510}>, <Internet of things: Perspectives, challenges and opportunities, {eid: 84891926117}>, <Internet of things for enterprise systems of modern manufacturing, {eid: 84900826011}>, <None, {eid: 84866627419}>, <Fog computing and the internet of things: Extend the cloud to where the things are, {eid: 85015736776}>, <OpenMTC: Prototyping machine type communication in carrier grade operator networks, {eid: 84875682868}>, <The internet of manufacturing things, {eid: 84923118227}>, <CCIoT-CMfg: Cloud computing and internet of things-based cloud manufacturing service system, {eid: 84896931467}>, <None, {eid: 85011017061}>, <None, {eid: 85011109692}>, <Machina research, {eid: 85011109687}>, <None, {eid: 84989304974}>, <The economic value of the industrial internet of things, {eid: 85006995919}>, <Condition monitoring in the cloud, {eid: 84964067339}>, <Industrial internet reference architecture, {eid: 84952899781}>, <A survey of fog computing, {eid: 84951050684}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2016-09-12,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85011062046

According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.","autonomous vehicle, cybersecurity attacks, electric vehicle, risk assessment, Security profiling",,,,,,,,"<Global EV outlook 2018: Towards cross-modal electrification, {eid: 85051234242}>, <None, {eid: 85174652491}>, <Cyber security issues of Internet of Electric vehicles, {eid: 85049220499}>, <None, {eid: 85070749007}>, <None, {eid: 85019623176, doi: 10.6028/NIST.IR.7628r1}>, <Integration of electric vehicles in smart grid: A review on vehicle to grid technologies and optimization techniques, {eid: 84943279578}>, <A double-edged sword?

However, very recently, these CPSs have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and the count is expected to increase significantly in the years to come. Under such scenarios, the conventional ITS solutions would fall short due to numerous technical limitations such as reduced flexibility, poor connectivity, limited scalability, and lack of adequate intelligence. In this direction, the cloud computing paradigm would also lag behind in meeting the following expected challenges: high mobility, minimal latency, realtime services, and high quality of service (QoS). Software defined networking (SDN) and edge computing (EC) are expected to be promising solutions for modern ITS. SDN allows efficient management of networks by virtue of its decoupled data and control planes. Moreover, EC is an extension of cloud computing that allows data processing, storage, and management at the edge of the network. Thus, these promising paradigms can address the network and data processing challenges of AV networks in rea time. Further, distributed mobility management (DMM) with improvised routing capabilities in the considered setup can bring added advantages in the form of zero tunneling overhead, full-fledged control of flow table entries, QoS-driven routing decisions, and efficient interplay between the edge and the cloud. Keeping in view the potential benefits of SDN, EC, and DMM in future AV networks, this work presents a composite framework with a distributed SDN-DMM approach in ITS ecosystems. Further, conventional DMM has been improved by stacking the Optimized Routing Decision module on it. This coupling yields a mobility-aware and QoS-driven (MobQoS) SDN framework for AVs that handles both the mobility and QoS challenges of the underlying vehicular networks. Additionally, it is also designed to handle the interplay between the edge and the cloud in an optimized manner using the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). Numerical comparisons depict that the proposed MobQoS outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of overall communication latency and bandwidth utilization. The performance assessment has been carried out using NS-3 and SUMO wherein an overall improvement of 15.95 percent has been reported in terms of end-to-end delay.",,,,,,,,,"<Vehicular communication networks in the automated driving era, {eid: 85053464685}>, <None, {eid: 85030213183}>, <None, {eid: 84962771752}>, <None, {eid: 85020716774}>, <Secure and energy-efficient handover in fog networks using blockchain-based dmm, {eid: 85047304367}>, <Routing optimization with SDN, {eid: 85152358990}>, <SDN-based distributed mobility management for 5g networks, {eid: 84989863887}>, <Dynamic anchor points selection for mobility management in software defined networks, {eid: 84938383525}>, <Software-defined networking: The new norm for networks, {eid: 84926351927}>, <Are we ready for SDN?

In these systems, people also play a pivotal role which includes both social and technical issues, making the design of these solutions a very complex task. This paper overviews the prevalent solutions and architecture design principles in IoT-big data ecosystems for smart cities sensing.

Due to their specific constraints, such as extreme dynamism and continuous evolution of the physical substratum, and requirements, such us openendedness and adaptability, CPS introduce many new challenges for software engineering.

The increasing complexity of frequently changing production environments challenges shop floor workers to perform well. The tasks they work on are getting less routine and ask for continuous knowledge and skills development. For example, the skills portfolio of workers likely requires improved higher-order thinking and decisionmaking skills. A wide range of research and development efforts already today sets focus on different areas of workplace learning, including performance appraisals, pedagogy and education, technology, and business economics. Bridging the skills gap, however, requires novel user-facing technologies - such as Augmented Reality (AR) and wearables - for human performance augmentation to improve efficiency and effectiveness of staff delivered through live guidance. AR branches out beyond mobile apps with 3Dobject superimposition for marketing purposes to rather complex use cases delivered by a rapidly growing innovation ecosystem of hard- and software providers collaborating closely with R&D organisations. This paper provides a first shared vision on how AR can tackle four different challenges related to handling complexity in a CPS environment: develop intelligent assistance systems for learning and performance assessment at the workplace, adapt job profiles accordingly, and last but not least to address also the issue of work-life balance. The paper concludes with an outline of a research roadmap.","Augmented Reality, Industry 4.0, Job Profiles, Performance Augmentation",,,,,,,,"<Digitising european industry - Reaping the full benefits of a digital single market, {eid: 85025171909}>, <The risk of automation for jobs in oecd countries, {eid: 85006165644}>, <None, {eid: 84999857315}>, <None, {eid: 85025155623}>, <None, {eid: 85025176945}>, <None, {eid: 85025155678}>, <None, {eid: 85011107651}>, <A new skills agenda for Europe, {eid: 85025159576}>, <None, {eid: 84940453073}>, <None, {eid: 85025139593}>, <None, {eid: 84991727983}>, <Proc. of workshop advanced manufacturing with augmented reality (in conjunction with ieee international symposium on mixed and augmented reality - Ismar2014), {eid: 85025141269}>, <None, {eid: 85025120579}>, <None, {eid: 84925860266}>, <None, {eid: 84890609381}>, <None, {eid: 84909987944}>, <The ironies of automation...

Especially cyber-physical systems should benefit by this progress to provide smart applications in ambient environments of private and industrial space. But a proper and methodical engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems (CPES) is still an open and important issue. Traditional software and systems engineering facilities (system models, description languages, or process models) do not consider fundamental characteristics of these ecosystems as openness, uncertainty, or emergent constitution at runtime sufficiently. But especially these aspects let blur the line of system boundaries at design time. The diverse components of CPES have essential impacts on the engineering of CPES as well, concerning time synchronizing, execution control, and interaction structure. Self-balanced control in CPES promises new application possibilities, but also needs new engineering techniques concerning the overall engineering process, including requirements engineering and runtime verification. In this position paper we survey and summarize the dimensions of challenges in applying control theory for the engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems.","Control theory, Cyber-physical systems, Self-balanced control, Software ecosystems, System-of-systems, Systems engineering",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85026985122}>, <None, {eid: 84960456333}>, <Component based design of hybrid systems: A case study on concurrency and coupling, {eid: 84899762130}>, <None, {eid: 80455156525}>, <Model measuring for hybrid systems, {eid: 84899733412}>, <Engineering of IT ecosystems: Design of ultra-large-scale software-intensive systems, {eid: 51849108041}>, <None, {eid: 84960470268}>, <Hybrid automata for formal modeling and verification of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84886711972}>, <CPS foundations, {eid: 77956210272}>, <DAiSI - Dynamic adaptive system infrastructure, {eid: 41149102755}>, <From software systems to complex software ecosystems: Model- and constraint-based engineering of ecosystems, {eid: 84929566040}>, <None, {eid: 84864260230}>, <None, {eid: 84960419359}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2015-08-31,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84960352275

The resulting systems are called Systems of Systems (SoSs). Software and systems engineering can make contributions to the necessary transformation of these systems. SoSs that are characterized by special dynamics (e.g., more frequent context changes) are referred to as dynamic SoSs (dynaSoS). Currently, there are still many open questions and challenges in their design and realization. In order to get an overview of these, in this paper we present a survey that was executed within the context of the project 'DynaSoS'. For this purpose, qualitative interviews were conducted with experts in software and SoS engineering from industry and academia. Based on the statements received, 36 challenges were grouped and prioritized in several workshops. This report provides an overview of ten central software engineering issues and research challenges in the realization of dynaSoS and aims to contribute to a better understanding of the application-oriented challenges facing industry.","Dynamic Systems of Systems, DynaSoS, Industry Voices, Interviews, Sustainability, System of Systems Engineering, Systems Engineering, Systems of Systems",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85169144781}>, <Systems of systems engineering in deutschland-bestandsaufnahme und ausblick, {eid: 85169135125}>, <Model-based engineering of collaborative embedded systems: Extensions of the spes methodology, {eid: 85169113522}>, <None, {eid: 85169077579}>, <Designing resilient systems-of-systems: A survey of metrics, methods, and challenges, {eid: 84947968441}>, <System-of-systems engineering management: A review of modern history and a path forward, {eid: 58549089874}>, <System of systems-the meaning of of, {eid: 33845926614}>, <System of systems modelling: Recent work review and a path forward, {eid: 85103824540}>, <Systems of systems engineering: Prospects and challenges for the emerging field, {eid: 79958085096}>, <General systems theory-the skeleton of science, {eid: 0000259654}>, <Systems and software engineering-Guidelines for the utilization of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 in the context of system of systems (SoS), {eid: 85169142906}>, <Architecting principles for systems-of-systems, {eid: 85045953475}>, <Sustainability of systems of systems, {eid: 84907449595}>, <None, {eid: 0031246468}>, <Towards a conceptual model to understand software ecosystems emerging from systems-of-information systems, {eid: 85090046009}>, <None, {eid: 85169083266}>, <Innovating for a sustainable future, {eid: 85169121621}>, <Core research and innovation areas in cyber-physical systems of systems, {eid: 84952670320}>, <The status quo of systems-of-information systems, {eid: 85073215854}>, <A taxonomy for system of autonomous systems, {eid: 85135130931}>, <None, {eid: 85166739027}>, <None, {eid: 85169104792}>, <Software product family evaluation, {eid: 35048855020}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85169097315

To contribute to closing this gap in the long run via problem-driven research, we need to first understand which contemporary challenges and needs are encountered in industry.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges.

Agility, privacy, and regulatory compliance are some of the advantages of hybrid clouds. However, the key characteristics of complex hybrid cloud application such as heterogeneity, reliability, interoperability, scalability, and dynamic nature also makes old static approaches brittle. A digital twin can capture real-time (meta) data of a hybrid cloud application and supply valuable insights for efficient management of the cloud services and analyzing faults. In this paper, we propose a digital twin assisted approach to analyze the faults, interoperability, and reliability issues of a hybrid cloud-based application. We also present some metamorphic relations to analyze the reliability of our twin. Insights from the digital twin can assist developers to take proactive measures before a fault occur. The digital twin can also help detect faults and identify the cause and remediation steps through data insights. The key advantage of using digital twin is that it helps detect issues in complex hybrid cloud applications in a holistic way.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering; • Computer systems organization ?

Despite the novelty of the area as it has been known, it follows a trend of previous complex systems, such as Federated Information Systems and Large-Scale Information Systems. However, operational and managerial independence of IS constituents have created a new type of system that must be understood to suitably support new business and modernize old ones, such as pizza delivery via drone swarms. Hence, to sustain the area and achieve advances, it is necessary to externalize the state of the art and practice of the area. However, the lack of literature mappings on this topic can hamper the evolution of the area and pose difficulties to its progress, besides making it difficult to obtain relevant information about existing gaps and advances that could be made in the future. This paper presents results of a Systematic Mapping (SM) carried out to investigate the status quo of SoIS domain. We bring a panorama of this research topic and also indicate research perspectives. From a set of 212 studies, 25 were selected, analyzed and had their data extracted. Results reveal that interoperability between different IS is still a challenge and the low number of studies referring to languages, techniques and tools for modeling SoIS architectures points to an important area of study to be researched in the next years.","System of Information System, Systematic Mapping",,,,,,,,"<On the interplay of business process modeling and missions in systems-ofinformation systems, {eid: 85026408179}>, <Mandala: An agent-based platform to support interoperability in systems-ofsystems, {eid: 85051172970}>, <Integration of statistical information systems-Theory and practice, {eid: 0028552654}>, <Strategies for information systems integration, {eid: 84868089074}>, <None, {eid: 84964922101}>, <None, {eid: 72349086391}>, <Information systems: Towards a system of information systems, {eid: 84960947090}>, <Architecting principles for systems-of-systems, {eid: 85045953475}>, <Smart systems-ofinformation systems: Foundations and an assessment model for research development, {eid: 85050546650}>, <Formally describing the software architecture of systems-of-systems with sosadl, {eid: 84985906010}>, <The contribution of systems science to information systems research, {eid: 0034344595}>, <Interoperability frameworks and enterprise architectures in e-government initiatives in Europe and the United States, {eid: 33845231386}>, <Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering, {eid: 44649122227}>, <Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: An update, {eid: 84929464206}>, <A systematic review of comparative evidence of aspect-oriented programming, {eid: 77953684337}>, <Empirical studies of agile software development: A systematic review, {eid: 44649189162}>, <On the use of description logic for semantic interoperability of enterprise systems, {eid: 78650748884}>, <E-agency: Implementation of the croatian post and electronic communications agency, {eid: 70649107114}>, <Managing the trust relationship in financial services information systems, {eid: 78650277800}>, <Integration principle as the master equation of the dynamics of an information system, {eid: 84892770927}>, <An architectural model for system of information systems, {eid: 84951168688}>, <Managing heterogeneous information in a system of information systems, {eid: 85075026971}>, <Integration of brainstorming platform in a system of information systems, {eid: 85009807561}>, <Moving from digital ecosystem to system of information systems, {eid: 84991737657}>, <Resources management and decision support in a system of information systems, {eid: 84969545661}>, <New challenges in the social web: Towards systems-of-information systems ecosystems, {eid: 85041418924}>, <System of information systems as support for learning ecosystem, {eid: 85041444279}>, <Towards a proactive interoperability solution in systems of information systems: A plm perspective, {eid: 85039427923}>, <Recommendation of pedagogical resources within a learning ecosystem, {eid: 85047267783}>, <Modeling and developing a system of information systems for managing heterogeneous resources, {eid: 85044180396}>, <System of information systems to support learners (a case study at the university of technology of compiègne), {eid: 85052062374}>, <How are combined expertise elements in early-warning systems?

At the same time, however, trustworthiness assurance is becoming extremely difficult in these complex ecosystems due to the high autonomy, unpredictability and limited controllability of their individual players. To mitigate safety risks for humans, these Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems (e.g., Smart Cities) might require their member systems (e.g., Autonomous Vehicles) to execute software modules called Smart Agents to ensure safe coordination among themselves. Unfortunately, this technology is currently in its very early development with many challenges ahead. Namely, there is no guaranteed way of ensuring that these agents run on the right piece of hardware, with the right privileges required to fulfill their roles, and without the execution environment tampering with their instructions. This way, the host system (e.g., the Autonomous Vehicle we need to control for the sake of the safety of other ecosystem members) can escape the actual safety measures to be enforced. In this paper, we are proposing a novel software architecture that focuses on the detection of instruction tampering and privileged access in Smart Agents, and this way support the vision of trustworthy and safe evolution of Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems.","autonomous ecosystems, autonomous systems, blockchain, trust, trusted execution",,,,,,,,"<Towards creation of a reference

Although the latest industry infrastructures largely depend on AI-driven maintenance, prediction based on corrupted data undoubtedly results in loss of life and capital. Admittedly, an inadequate data protection mechanism can readily challenge the security and reliability of the network. The shortcomings of the conventional cloud or trust-ed-certificate-driven techniques have motivated us to exhibit a unique blockchain-based framework for a secure and efficient Industry 4.0 system. The demonstrated framework obviates the long-established certificate authority after enhancing the consortium blockchain that reduces the data processing delay and increases cost-effective throughput. Nonetheless, the distributed Industry 4.0 security model entails cooperative trust rather than depending on a single party, which in essence indulges the costs and threat of the single point of failure. Therefore, the multi-signature technique of the proposed framework accomplishes multi-party authentication, which confirms its applicability for a real-time and collaborative cyber-physical system.",,,,,,,,,"<Deploying fog computing in industrial internet of things and industry4.0, {eid: 85049803971}>, <SPB: A secure private blockchain-based solution for distributed energy trading, {eid: 85069522430}>, <Applications of distributed ledger technologies to the internet of things: A survey, {eid: 85075606103}>, <A survey on privacy protection in block chain system, {eid: 85056968951}>, <Bitcoin and beyond: A technical survey on decentralized digital currencies, {eid: 84985991912}>, <Blockchain standard: Can we reach consensus?, {eid: 85074675961}>, <Blockchain-based lightweight certificate authority for efficient privacy-preserving location-based service in vehicular social networks, {eid: 85089310594}>, <Blockchain for large-scale internet of things data storage and protection, {eid: 85049481081}>, <Integrated blockchain and edge computing systems: A survey, some research issues and challenges, {eid: 85062522283}>, <Lightweight multi-party authentication and key-agreement protocol in iot based e-health care service, {eid: 85107482662}>, <Compact multi-signatures for smaller blockchains, {eid: 85057419862}>, <Security and privacy in decentralized energy trading through multi-signatures, blockchain and anonymous messaging streams, {eid: 85051646466}>, <GDPR-compliant personal data management: A blockchain-based solution, {eid: 85079575698}>, <Blockchain-enabled smart contracts: Architecture, applications, and future trends, {eid: 85064209613}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-05-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85107489196

This paper presents the OpenUAV testbed, an open-source, easy-to-use, web-based, and reproducible software system that enables students and researchers to run robotic simulations on the cloud. We have built upon our previous work and have addressed some of the educational and research challenges associated with the prior work. The critical contributions of the paper to the robotics and automation community are threefold: First, OpenUAV saves students and researchers from tedious and complicated software setups by providing web-browser-based Linux desktop sessions with standard robotics software like Gazebo, ROS, and flight autonomy stack. Second, a method for saving an individual's research work with its dependencies for the work's future reproducibility. Third, the platform provides a mechanism to support photorealistic robotics simulations by combining Unity game engine-based camera rendering and Gazebo physics.

These services enable the emergence of multiple end-to-end cyber-physical scenarios, formed dynamically based on their demands, e.g., disaster recovery systems. In such scenarios, each cyber-physical flow may be composed of a large number of physical services with composition challenges such as high dynamism of CPS platforms, rapid development and scalability, and real-time and reliable processing and controlling tasks. Cloud computing enables new perspectives in the design and operation of CPSs, including consolidating and sharing physical services among different applications, auto-scaling computing and communication, and designing and maintaining multiple in-Cloud CPSs dynamically at the same time. In this paper, we present a new architectural approach to address the key concerns of a new generation of CPS services whose functionalities reside in-Cloud (cyber), and on devices and systems (physical). In particular, this design space is focused on principles that allow in-Cloud evolution of CPS services, including dynamic in-Cloud service composition and distribution, virtualization of physical services and devices, and the dynamic creation of CPS ecosystems. In this design model, the in-Cloud cyber part may evolve independently, while the on-device cyber and physical platform still work closely together and provide the basic CPS services.","Architecture, Cloud, Cyber-Physical Systems, Evolution, Service Design",,,,,,,,"<Cyber-physical systems: The next computing revolution, {eid: 77956217277}>, <Challenges and research directions in medical cyber physical systems, {eid: 84155167716}>, <A vision of cyber-physical cloud computing for smart networked systems, {eid: 84916604600}>, <A soa-based architecture for empowering future collaborative cloud-based industrial automation, {eid: 84872933340}>, <V-cloud: Vehicular cyber-physical systems and cloud computing, {eid: 84900524113}>, <Service-oriented paradigms in industrial automation, {eid: 17444427689}>, <Sensor cloud: A cloud of virtual sensors, {eid: 84897093175}>, <Sensor-cloud infrastructure-physical sensor management with virtualized sensors on cloud computing, {eid: 78650497196}>, <Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc., {eid: 84916621415}>, <Robust and resilient control design for cyberphysical systems with an application to power systems, {eid: 84860668871}>, <None, {eid: 84930701770}>, <Modeling of future cyber physical energy systems for distributed sensing and control, {eid: 77953723898}>, <Adaptive and dynamic service composition in eflow, {eid: 0344303323}>, <None, {eid: 33744965907}>, <Towards runtime discovery, selection and composition of semantic services, {eid: 78651317506}>, <None, {eid: 84916621413}>, <Vcmia: A novel architecture for integrating vehicular cyber-physical systems and mobile cloud computing, {eid: 84898828128}>, <Information-acquisition-as-a-service for cyberphysical cloud computing, {eid: 84960132236}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2014-08-25,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84916613337

Within this ecosystem, industrial products will be developed, produced/manufactured, monitored and maintained using available data and information. The characteristic of this new ecosystem will be that people, production processes, organisations and cyber-physical systems, interconnected in a socio-technical whole, will exchange and share information and will interact and produce on this basis. The scope of this worldwide ecosystem means it can be characterised as an ultra-large-scale system. Given the scope of this ecosystem as a new entity and the diversity of players linked within it, it is necessary to acquire new knowledge and insights applicable to the development and management of these enormous networks and the number of players present within them. This paper's central issue is to investigate whether complexity science can support the development and elaboration of an industrial Infosphere.

Many disciplines can benefit from the advancement of the Metaverse when accurately developed, including the fields of technology, gaming, education, art &#x0026; culture, socialization, commerce, and businesses. Nevertheless, developing the Metaverse environment to its full potential is an ambiguous task that needs proper guidance and directions. Existing surveys on the Metaverse focus only on a specific aspect and discipline of the Metaverse and lack a holistic view of the entire process. Moreover, most surveys refrain from providing detailed guidance about the development process of the metaverse, including its impact on technologies, businesses, existing challenges, and potential research directions due to their lack of a macro and micro perception of such a topic. To this end, a more holistic, multi-disciplinary, in-depth, and academic and industry-oriented review is required to provide a thorough study of the Metaverse development pipeline and fill the gap in existing Metaverse surveys. To address these issues, we present in this survey a novel multi-layered pipeline ecosystem composed of (1) the Metaverse computing, networking, communications and hardware infrastructure, (2) environment digitization, and (3) user interactions. For every layer, we discuss the components that detail the steps of its development. Also, for each of these components, we examine the impact of a set of enabling technologies and empowering domains (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Security &#x0026; Privacy, Blockchain, Business, Ethics, and Social) on its advancement. In addition, we explain the importance of these technologies to support decentralization, interoperability, user experiences, interactions, and monetization. Our presented study highlights the existing challenges for each component, followed by research directions and potential solutions.

It will allow 'things' to be connected anytime, anywhere, with anything and anyone, providing a myriad of novel applications and augmented services to citizens, governments, and enterprises. We believe that for the IoT to reach its full potential, it will be necessary to advance the investigation of techniques and technologies to build systems in such a brand-new scenario. In the IoT, the collaborating entities encompass both physical and virtual resources, interactions occur both in an active and programmed way as well as by chance, and therefore it is necessary to deal with expected but also emerging behaviors of the collaborating parties. In this paper, we first discuss the main features that make IoT a unique ecosystem, and as such, calls for new software development solutions. We claim that there is a need to rethinking the techniques and methodologies for developing IoT systems and applications. Novel models, architectural approaches and techniques should be proposed, or existing ones should be adapted to deal with the high heterogeneity, dynamism, serendipity and interdependencies that are typical of the IoT ecosystem. We then analyze and discuss potential key design solutions that deserve a deeper understanding in order to pave the way for the building of this new generation of systems. Our discussion is presented from a bottom-up perspective: from the modeling of devices that make up the \mathrm{IoT} to the representation of requirements that must be addressed when engineering IoT systems.","Adaptive Systems, Internet of Things, Model-driven development, Requirements, Software Architecture",,,,,,,,"<Chaos engineering, {eid: 84968821016}>, <Internet of things: A survey on enabling technologies, protocols and applications, {eid: 84941085241}>, <A multi-Agent autonomous intersection management (MA-AIM) system for smart cities leveraging edge-of-Things and Blockchain, {eid: 85081013719}>, <Exploring the effectiveness of service decomposition in fog computing architecture for the internet of things, {eid: 85080829519}>, <Modeling soa-based iot applications with soaml4iot in proceedings of the, {eid: 85073912825}>, <None, {eid: 84941067484}>, <Wont take no for an answer: Resource-driven requirements adaptation, {eid: 85071135587}>, <Model-driven development a metamodeling foundation, {eid: 0141725648}>, <None, {eid: 85100732475}>, <None, {eid: 85094046168}>, <Fog function: Serverless fog computing for data intensive iot services, {eid: 85072574704}>, <Model-driven engineering for mission-critical IoT systems, {eid: 85010302951}>, <Evaluation of constrained application protocol for wireless sensor networks, {eid: 84856157262}>, <Modeling IoT applications with SysML4IoT, {eid: 85020698595}>, <A survey on human-in-The-loop applications towards an internet of all, ieee commun, {eid: 84930196742}>, <Forms: Unifying reference model for formal specification of distributed self-Adaptive systems, {eid: 84862088448}>, <Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later: A literature review, {eid: 77955227439, doi: 10.1016/j.is.2010.01.001}>, <None, {eid: 84917712711}>, <None, {eid: 85056204955}>, <Towards an iot ecosystem, {eid: 84882399063}>, <A review on the use of blockchain for the internet of things, {eid: 85047783561}>, <AutoRELAX: Automatically RELAXing a goal model to address uncertainty, {eid: 84907594075}>, <None, {eid: 84873547642}>, <None, {eid: 85100706203}>, <Goal modeling in requirements engineering: Analysis and critique of current methods, {eid: 33751567345}>, <The architecture tradeoff analysis method, {eid: 84985008410}>, <None, {eid: 85073685795}>, <Fuzzy Goals for Requirements-Driven Adaptation, {eid: 78650408637}>, <Human-in-The-loop mobile networks: A survey of recent advancements, {eid: 85019652763}>, <Towards adaptive systems through requirements@run-Time, {eid: 84891929575}>, <None, {eid: 84870840595}>, <People-centric cognitive internet of things for the quantitative analysis of environmental exposure, {eid: 85053701897}>, <On design issues and architectural styles for blockchain-driven IoT services, {eid: 85028499430}>, <A survey of autonomic computing-degrees, models, and applications, {eid: 42449088961}>, <Increasing the dependability of iot middleware with cloud computing and microservices, {eid: 85057284037}>, <A taxonomy of variability realization techniques, {eid: 21644473421, doi: 10.1002/spe.652}>, <Depsys: Dependency-Aware integration of systems for smart homes, {eid: 84904512295}>, <Requirements reflection requirements as run-Time entities, {eid: 77954721043}>, <FRASAD: A framework for model-driven IoT application development, {eid: 84964510032}>, <Kappa: Serverless IoT deployment, {eid: 85050674397}>, <A microservices architecture for reactive and proactive fault tolerance in iot systems, {eid: 85053778476}>, <Architecture-driven development approach for wsan applications, {eid: 84963900789}>, <None, {eid: 85100707753}>, <New cyber physical system challenges for human-in-The-loop control, {eid: 85026563017}>, <Data-centric resource management in edge-cloud systems for the iot, {eid: 85100767006}>, <The emergence of edge computing, {eid: 85009446769}>, <The future of human-in-The-loop cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84873315082}>, <Towards feature-oriented variability reconfiguration in dynamic software product lines, {eid: 85051760549}>, <How low energy is bluetooth low energy?

However, conceptual challenges related to the actors definition arise when mapping new digital applications to SGAM, among others such as artificial intelligence and digital twins.Thus, this paper explores the latter challenges and presents three potential solutions to facilitate the deployment of digital applications in SGAM. These solutions are (i) the integration of a new interoperability layer to cover digital applications and humans in the current SGAM design, (ii) the decoupling of the component layer in three layers regarding the typology of actors, and (iii) the integration of a new interoperability layer to better represent the digital actors in cyber-physical applications.","AI, cyber-physical applications, digitalization, SGAM, smart grid reference architecture model, Smart grids",,,,,,,,"<Emerging power quality challenges due to integration of renewable energy sources, {eid: 85017639807}>, <A review of the development of Smart Grid technologies, {eid: 84959312803}>, <Application of big data and machine learning in smart grid, and associated security concerns: A review, {eid: 85061715299}>, <Smart grids: A cyber-physical systems perspective, {eid: 84977950273}>, <Applying the smart grid architecture model for designing and validating system-of-systems in the power and energy domain: A European perspective, {eid: 85060533877}>, <None, {eid: 72449191827}>, <Ieee grid vision 2050, {eid: 85083963133}>, <None, {eid: 84888597791}>, <None, {eid: 85143829304}>, <None, {eid: 84883366086}>, <Introduction to the Digitalization of Power Systems and Markets, {eid: 85143755521}>, <None, {eid: 85143812732}>, <Representing Decision-Makers in SGAMH: The Smart Grid Architecture Model Extended with the Human Layer, {eid: 85097438845}>, <Smart grid architecture model for control, optimization and data analytics of future power networks with more renewable energy, {eid: 85104064623}>, <None, {eid: 77957988874}>, <None, {eid: 85143768630}>, <SGAM-based methodology to analyse Smart Grid solutions in DISCERN European research project, {eid: 84904978556}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2022-10-10,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85143787815

To do that, four main challenges had to be addressed, namely: the data accessibility challenge, the data interoperability challenge, the machine variability challenge, and the resource usage challenge. In the end, the logical connector presented in this paper has shown to enable the migration of legacy production lines into an Industry 4.0 ecosystem and thus to reap some of the benefits promised by Industry 4.0.","data interoperability, Industry 4.0, legacy production lines, migration",,,,,,,,"<Industry 4. 0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Industry 4. 0: Towards future industrial opportunities and challenges, {eid: 84966558951}>, <Industry 4. 0: State of the art and future trends, {eid: 85064005739}>, <Industry 4. 0 tech_nologies: Implementation patterns in manufacturing companies, {eid: 85060082633}>, <Industry 4. 0-A Glimpse, {eid: 85042481468}>, <The expected contribution of Industry 4. 0 technologies for industrial performance, {eid: 85053112719}>, <Opportunities for Industry 4. 0 to Support Remanufacturing, {eid: 85050389106}>, <Industry 4. 0 value networks in legacy systems, {eid: 84952920897}>, <Industry 4. 0 Retrofitting, {eid: 85065092100}>, <Future_Fit: A strategy for getting a production asset to an industry 4. 0 component-a human-centered approach, {eid: 85083531054}>, <Smart retrofitting in manufacturing: A systematic review, {eid: 85107317101}>, <Enabling servi_tization by retrofitting legacy equipment for Industry 4. 0 applications: Benefits and barriers for OEMs, {eid: 85095126493}>, <A non-intrusive Industry 4. 0 retrofitting approach for collaborative maintenance in tra_ditional manufacturing, {eid: 85121898778}>, <Digital Retrofitting of legacy machines: A holistic procedure model for industrial companies, {eid: 85119093699}>, <A novel methodology for retrofitting CNC machines based on the context of industry 4. 0, {eid: 85040118032}>, <Implementing an OPC UA interface for legacy PLC-based automation systems using the Azure cloud: An ICPS-architecture with a retrofitted RFID system, {eid: 85050127362}>, <Steps towards digitization of manufacturing in an SME environment, {eid: 85083531078}>, <Cyber-physical production systems retrofitting in context of industry 4. 0, {eid: 85075855259}>, <Smart Manufacturing Retrofit for Brownfield Systems, {eid: 85084196169}>, <Semantic Interoperability in Industry 4. 0: Survey of Recent Developments and Outlook, {eid: 85055539075}>, <A Review of Interoperability Standards for Industry 4. 0, {eid: 85083536146}>, <Data Han_dling in Industry 4. 0: Interoperability Based on Distributed Ledger Technology, {eid: 85085904300}>, <Selection of a data exchange format for industry 4. 0 manufacturing systems, {eid: 85010036599}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-07-25,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85145778803

In this paper, we discuss the challenges and possible solutions for IoT security that needs to be addressed at IoT perception layer/Edge node. The inevitable component of the IoT edge node is microcontroller/System on Chip (SoC). The microcontroller/SoC used in sensitive applications consists of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a hardware support for security. TEE's are not sufficient to address all the security issues in IoT systems.Hardware security issues like hardware Trojans, counterfeiting and debug security are tightly interlinked with the IoT perception layer security. There can be common solution to the hardware security issues and IoT perception layer security. In this paper, we briefly discuss the challenges in IoT design, IoT security, vulnerabilities of edge device, existing solutions and need for new security architecture for IoT edge nodes. And finally we present what security features, the next generation SoC/microcontrollers should incorporate to solve both hardware intrinsic security and IoT perception layer security more holistically.","Hardware Security, Internet of Things, Microcontroller/System-on-Chip Security, Security Infrastructure IP",,,,,,,,"<The internet of things-how the next evolution of the internet is changing everything, {eid: 84866409323}>, <The changing computing paradigm with internet of things: A tutorial introduction"", {eid: 84963969119}>, <None, {eid: 85172523207}>, <A cloud computing based network monitoring and threat detection system for critical infrastructures, {eid: 84949671050}>, <Design and realization of winternet: From net of things to internet of things, {eid: 85030651432}>, <Cyber physical system: Architecture, applications and research challenges, {eid: 84893545247}>, <A survey on internet of things: Architecture enabling technologies security and privacy and applications, {eid: 85026378512}>, <Trusted execution environment: What it is, and what it is not, {eid: 84967164163}>, <None, {eid: 84855239573}>, <Innovative instructions and software model for isolated execution, {eid: 84893423195}>, <None, {eid: 84888998673}>, <On-board credentials with open provisioning, {eid: 74049088382}>, <Hypervision across worlds: Real-time kernel protection from the arm trustzone secure world, {eid: 84910673981}>, <None, {eid: 85052404045}>, <None, {eid: 84967215465}>, <Sapper: A language for hardware-level security policy enforcement, {eid: 84897760347}>, <Security assurance for system-on-chip designs with untrusted ips, {eid: 85018975651}>, <Physical unclonable functions and applications: A tutorial, {eid: 84904855440}>, <None, {eid: 85172524037}>, <Cryptographic key generation from puf data using efficient fuzzy extractors, {eid: 84898979224}>, <None, {eid: 85172552105}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2017-12-18,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85052380119

Interoperability among devices and machines is one of the challenges. Sensors, components and machines from different vendors work as independent silos offering large amounts of heterogeneous data which relational capabilities are not fully exploited. Quick development, deployment and testing of new software solutions that take advantage of those data is another important matter. The requirements in terms of equipment resources and engineering efforts is high when planning new implementations. Platforms that enable the efficient application of those solutions at the right level (machine, edge, plant or cloud) are also necessary.(p)(/p)This paper presents an industrial case study on the application of the Arrowhead framework. The framework is implemented in the Machine Tooling ecosystem and enables the integration of grinding machines with other sensors, components or machines. Different software engineering tools offered with Arrowhead are used to design new solutions in Cyber-Physical System and Internet of Things in Industry 4.0 and make them Arrowhead compliant, for fast deployment of platforms and applications (Dockers) or for testing purposes (Management tool). Finally, the potential of agile construction of new applications is analysed by providing an Human-Machine Interface at machine level and the provision of services for data consumption at cloud level.","Arrowhead, Cyber-Physical System, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things",,,,,,,,"<(smart cps) an internet-of-things (iot) based cyber manufacturing framework for the assembly of microdevices, {eid: 85064537008}>, <Iot powered servitization of manufacturing-an exploratory case study, {eid: 85015303829}>, <Fog computing and its role in the internet of things, {eid: 84866627419}>, <Analysis of technological architectures for the new paradigm of the industry 4. 0, {eid: 85086037916}>, <Strategic r&d opportunities for 21st century cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84885811607}>, <Smart servitization within the context of industrial user-supplier relationships: Contingencies according to a machine tool manufacturer, {eid: 84980030824}>, <Interoperability for industrial cyber-physical systems: An approach for legacy systems, {eid: 85028505206}>, <Co-simulation of cyber physical systems with hmi for human in the loop investigations, {eid: 85020638432}>, <Edge-cloud orchestration driven industrial smart product-service systems solution design based on cps and iiot, {eid: 85072256748}>, <Cps (cyber physical system) based manufacturing system optimization, {eid: 85040308175}>, <Big data for cyber physical systems in industry 4. 0: A survey, {eid: 85042909694}>, <Summarisation and relevance evaluation techniques for big data exploration: The smart factory case study, {eid: 85021216074}>, <Scalability analysis comparisons of cloudbased software services, {eid: 85069539990}>, <None, {eid: 85181385491}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <None, {eid: 85092433848}>, <The internet of things vision: Key features, applications and open issues, {eid: 84915801700}>, <Internet of things reference architectures, security and interoperability: A survey, {eid: 85057160902}>, <Emerging technologies: Iot, big data, and cps with sensory systems, {eid: 85043372523}>, <Experience based knowledge representation for internet of things and cyber physical systems with case studies, {eid: 85041998745}>, <A constraint mining approach to support monitoring cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85067358156}>, <A game-theoretic approach to cross-layer security decision-making in industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85074682384}>, <On the safety of iot device physical interaction control, {eid: 85056864669}>, <The relevance of software documentation, tools and technologies: A survey, {eid: 0141650592}>, <Semi-automatic ontology-driven development documentation: Generating documents from rdf data and dita templates, {eid: 85065672913}>, <Emulation-in-the-loop for simulation and testing of realtime critical cps, {eid: 85050107971}>, <A learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration development and testing practice, {eid: 85056634616}>, <Modeldriven automated deployment of large-scale cps co-simulations in the cloud, {eid: 85041450565}>, <Orchestration of microservices for iot using docker and edge computing, {eid: 85053467724}>, <A modular cps architecture design based on ros and docker, {eid: 84964196260}>, <None, {eid: 84971519599}>, <None, {eid: 84874429477}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2020-10-19,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85097802020

With these new capabilities comes new challenges in scale, complexity, and the skills needed to enable ubiquitous system integration. While in the past, engineers have utilized a variety of proprietary graphical configuration and programming tools to intuitively create simple to complex manufacturing systems, presently, the standard technology ecosystem which engineers design, control, and maintain, is observably expanding, and/or evolving to incorporate more open-source technologies, network services, and distributed devices. Therefore, this paper will examine the emerging next generation technologies and tools which will support engineers in designing and interacting with the new digital manufacturing ecosystem in smart factories. To achieve this: a state-of-the-art survey of commercial Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology is presented; three key ubiquitous technology trends are examined; and a use-case is presented with a universal framework.

Containerization allows for better resource utilization, platform-independent development, and secure deployment of software. Orchestration automates the deployment, networking, scaling, and availability of containerized workloads and services. While containerization is increasingly being adopted in the robotic community, the use of task orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) is still an open challenge. The biggest limitation is due to the fact that state-of-the-art orchestrators do not support real-time (RT) containers, while advanced robotic software often consists of a mix of heterogeneous tasks (i.e., ROS nodes) with different levels of temporal constraints (i.e., mixed-criticality systems). This work addresses this challenge by presenting RT-Kube, a platform that extends the de-facto reference standard for container orchestration, Kubernetes, to schedule tasks with mixed-criticality requirements. It implements monitoring of tasks and detects missed deadlines for those with RT constraints. It selects low-priority tasks to be migrated at runtime to different units of the computing cluster to free resources and recover from temporal violations. We present quantitative experimental results on the software implementing the mission of a Robotnik RB-Kairos mobile robot to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Such an intensive use of data raises however major privacy concerns, especially in the mobile application ecosystem. In this paper, we first show different examples of privacy breaches that can arise in such ecosystem. Those examples show that achieving privacy is challenging and there is no unique technique that one can use; rather one must combine different techniques depending also on the intended use of data. We then outline critical challenges towards achieving comprehensive privacy solutions.","cellular network protocols, data privacy, data transparency, Mobile applications, privacy enhancing techniques",,,,,,,,"<5g security and privacy: A research roadmap, {eid: 85100384628}>, <Iot security a comprehensive life cycle framework, {eid: 85080970461}>, <None, {eid: 85064744691}>, <Towards 6g networks: Use cases and technologies, {eid: 85082398538}>, <None, {eid: 85082475137}>, <A survey of covid-19contact tracing apps, {eid: 85089305054}>, <Phy-layer location privacy-preserving access point selection mechanism in next-generation wireless networks, {eid: 84966292103}>, <Privacy attacks to the 4g and 5g cellular paging protocols using side channel information, {eid: 85137909890}>, <Lteinspector: A systematic approach for adversarial testing of 4g lte, {eid: 85118534890}>, <5GReasoner: A Property-Directed Security and Privacy Analysis Framework for 5G Cellular Network Protocol, {eid: 85075929999}>, <50 Ways to leak your data: An exploration of apps circumvention of the android permissions system, {eid: 85076345414}>, <None, {eid: 85100383844}>, <Datafly: A system for providing anonymity in medical data, {eid: 0242698173}>, <Insecure connection bootstrapping in cellular networks: The root of all evil, {eid: 85066754809}>, <Protecting the 4g and 5g cellular paging protocols against security and privacy attacks, {eid: 85081098307}>, <Finding flaws from password authentication code in android apps, {eid: 85075618813}>, <An empirical study of sms one-time password authentication in android apps, {eid: 85077821224}>, <Context-based access control systems for mobile devices, {eid: 84925259610}>, <Identidroid: Android can finally wear its anonymous suit, {eid: 84899651651}>, <Redefining data transparency: A multidimensional approach, {eid: 85063031072}>, <A roadmap for a rigorous science of interpretability, {eid: 85095970037}>, <Jarvis: Moving towards a smarter internet of things, {eid: 85100391190}>, <Oblivious data structures, {eid: 84910678637}>, <Efficient k-Anonymization using clustering techniques, {eid: 38049126170}>, <Differential privacy: From theory to practice, {eid: 85020613543}>, <The probe framework for the personalized cloaking of private locations, {eid: 78650599919}>, <A secure location-based alert system with tunable privacy-performance trade-off, {eid: 85100432056}>, <Privacy-preserving and content-protecting location based queries, {eid: 84901007797}>, <Dbmask: Fine-grained access control on encrypted relational databases, {eid: 85007495582}>, <Privacy preserving delegated access control in public clouds, {eid: 84948655533}>, <An efficient certificateless encryption for secure data sharing in public clouds, {eid: 84959540048}>, <Security and trust in online social networks, {eid: 84919333893}>, <None, {eid: 85114480446}>, <Rahasnym: Protecting against linkability in the digital identity ecosystem, {eid: 84944322580}>, <Prividex: Privacy preserving and secure exchange of digital identity assets, {eid: 85066886046}>, <Privacy and contextual integrity: Framework and applications, {eid: 33751063543}>, <A security punctuation framework for enforcing access control on streaming data, {eid: 52649140439}>, <Security and privacy in the iot, {eid: 85042218584}>, <Data security and privacy in the iot, {eid: 85030657866}>, <Security challenges for medical devices, {eid: 84925779811}>, <Security & privacy in smart toys, {eid: 85037099584}>, <Firmalice-Automatic detection of authentication bypass vulnerabilities in binary firmware, {eid: 85112580749}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2020-12-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85100417944

As a matter of fact, the CPS growing market potential is scarcely supported by tools able to sustain the solid ecosystem required for a relevant market uptake. This issue becomes even more constraining the moment the concept of CPS is extended and aggregated to propose cyber-physical machines and manufacturing systems, where the complexity of the controlling intelligence and of the digital counterpart explodes. This paper aims at describing how the design and implementation of a multi-sided platform (MSP) for CPS deployment within the automation sector can provide the technological background to incentivize their adoption. In fact, the market needs an economic support to accelerate the transition towards new paradigms for the development of the software components of a mechatronic system. Developing an infrastructure on the top of which the CPS value chain can be instantiated and orchestrated, we provide the technical means to incentivize the creation of such an ecosystem able to support SMEs in their transition towards Industry 4.0.","Business model for multi-sided platform, Digital Twin, Factory automation, IEC 61499, Multi-sided platform",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85049949184}>, <Digital twin\-The simulation aspect, {eid: 85016457439}>, <Future digital design and manufacturing: Embracing industry 4. 0 and beyond, {eid: 85040776788}>, <Plug-and-simulate within modular assembly line enabled by digital twins and the use of automationml, {eid: 85044297204}>, <Industry 4. 0 and its impact on reshoring decisions of German manufacturing enterprises, {eid: 85037870595}>, <IEc 61499 as enabler of distributed and intelligent automation: State-of-The-art review, {eid: 81255138946}>, <None, {eid: 84892335131}>, <None, {eid: 0003586779}>, <An IEC 61499 configuration with 70 controllers; Challenges, benefits and a discussion on technical decisions, {eid: 54849435997}>, <Distributed execution and cyber-physical design of Baggage Handling automation with IEC 61499, {eid: 80054993029}>, <None, {eid: 84944689700}>, <Future modeling and simulation of cps-based factories: An example from the automotive industry, {eid: 85012920563}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <The Digital Twin of an industrial production line within the industry 4. 0 concept, {eid: 85027512911}>, <A microservice-based middleware for the digital factory, {eid: 85029892628}>, <Industry platform and ecosystem innovation, {eid: 84898004011}>, <None, {eid: 84984662709}>, <None, {eid: 85050123861}>, <Mapping out the sharing economy: A configurational approach to sharing business modeling, {eid: 85017154235}>, <None, {eid: 84990931636}>, <None, {eid: 85050119164}>, <Integration of classical components into industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84964264756}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2018-05-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85050144169

Several works have been pushing towards visual programming solutions to abstract the underlying complexity and help humans reason about it.

Digitization of complex cyber-physical systems is a promising approach to bringing into action the massive deployment of PV panels in the energy system. In this paper, we will focus on the computational tools for Digital Twining PV modules as they are an enabler of digitalization. The current study represents the initial phase of a project aimed at designing the Digital Twin of a PV module, which encompasses three primary objectives: firstly, enhancing the resilience of the energy system; secondly, introducing the concept of the Internet of Energy; and thirdly, establishing the Digital Twin as a service (DTaaS). The article details the comparison between open-source tools (pvlib, Photovoltaic-Modeling) with commercial software (Matlab Sim-scape) that forms the backbone of the computational Digital Twins of a PV module. The results show that none of the numerical models performs well under low irradiation conditions. Moreover, the benchmarking reveals a significant disparity in the estimation of shunt resistance $(R_{sh})$ between the open-source library (Photo-voltaic Modeling) and the commercial tool.","Digital Twins, Matlab, Photovoltaic Cell, Photovoltaic Modeling, PV Modeling, PV Modules, pvlib, Simscape, Simulink, Smart Building, Smart City",,,,,,,,"<Digitalization in energy sector, {eid: 85142758226}>, <Digitization, digital twins, blockchain, and industry 4. 0 as elements of management process in enterprises in the energy sector, {eid: 85105108696}>, <None, {eid: 85182596359}>, <None, {eid: 84896545135}>, <None, {eid: 85115814477}>, <None, {eid: 85182588820}>, <PV panel model based on datasheet values, {eid: 47049122000}>, <The numerical calculation of single-diode solar-cell modelling parameters, {eid: 84904548194}>, <Comprehensive approach to modeling and simulation of photovoltaic arrays, {eid: 67349141404}>, <4-modelling and prediction of pv module energy yield, {eid: 85010743434}>, <Chapter 9-sm-and fl-based mralfc schemes for solar-wind-based microgrid, {eid: 85117132616}>, <The MATLAB toolbox for EnergyPLAN: A tool to extend energy planning studies, {eid: 85079374999}>, <Review of open source tools for pv modeling, {eid: 85059901665}>, <Topsis and modified topsis: A comparative analysis, {eid: 85124873064}>, <None, {eid: 85083316557}>, <Exact analytical solutions of the parameters of real solar cells using lambert w-function, {eid: 0742271782}>, <Root finding methods: Newton raphson method, {eid: 85098559278}>, <Comparative study of bisection, newtonraphson and secant methods of root-finding problems, {eid: 85050987654}>, <None, {eid: 0003465464}>, <Bisection is optimal, {eid: 0000268052}>, <pvlib python: A python package for modeling solar energy systems, {eid: 85059629026}>, <None, {eid: 77955270803}>, <None, {eid: 85182593782}>, <Improvement and validation of a model for photovoltaic array performance, {eid: 29144478675}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-11-14,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85182602460

The increasing reliance on satellite services for safety-of-life and mission-critical applications (e.g., transport, defense and public safety services) creates a severe, although often overlooked, security problem, particularly when it comes to cyber threats. Like other increasingly digitized services, satellites and space platforms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Thus, the existence of cybersecurity flaws may pose major threats to space-based assets and associated key infrastructure on the ground. These dangers could obstruct global economic progress and, by implication, international security if they are not properly addressed. Mega-constellations make protecting space infrastructure from cyberattacks much more difficult. This emphasizes the importance of defensive cyber countermeasures to minimize interruptions and ensure efficient and reliable contributions to critical infrastructure operations. Very importantly, space systems are inherently complex Cyber-Physical System (CPS) architectures, where communication, control and computing processes are tightly interleaved, and associated hardware/software components are seamlessly integrated. This represents a new challenge as many known physical threats (e.g., conventional electronic warfare measures) can now manifest their effects in cyberspace and, vice-versa, some cyber-threats can have detrimental effects in the physical domain. The concept of cyberspace underlies nearly every aspect of modern society's critical activities and relies heavily on critical infrastructure for economic advancement, public safety and national security. Many governments have expressed the desire to make a substantial contribution to secure cyberspace and are focusing on different aspects of the evolving industrial ecosystem, largely under the impulse of digital transformation and sustainable development goals. The level of cybersecurity attained in this framework is the sum of all national and international activities implemented to protect all actions in the cyber-physical ecosystem. This paper focuses on cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in various segments of space CPS architectures. More specifically, the paper identifies the applicable cyber threat mechanisms, conceivable threat actors and the associated space business implications. It also presents metrics and strategies for countering cyber threats and facilitating space mission assurance.","Avionics Systems, Cyber-Physical Systems, Cybersecurity, Cyberspace, Cyberthreats, Mission Assurance, Safety-Critical Infrastructure, Satellite Systems, Space Infrastructure, Space Systems",,,,,,,,"<Space Resilience-Why and How?, {eid: 85141937916}>, <None, {eid: 85106821556}>, <Space Traffic Management: Towards Safe and Unsegregated Space Transport Operations, {eid: 85060983065, doi: 10.1016/j.paerosci.2018.10.006}>, <Space Systems Security Definition and Domain Mapping, {eid: 85141934068}>, <Hybrid warfare and societal resilience implications for democratic governance, {eid: 85098498498}>, <Connecting conflict concepts: Hybrid warfare and wardens rings, {eid: 85141936684}>, <None, {eid: 85081365190}>, <None, {eid: 85099872174}>, <None, {eid: 85121279783}>, <Space Dependence-A Critical Vulnerability of the Net-Centric Operational Commander, {eid: 85141939522}>, <The Cyber-ASAT: On the Impact of Cyber Weapons in Outer Space, {eid: 85069199396, doi: 10.23919/CYCON.2019.8756904}>, <None, {eid: 85056151063}>, <None, {eid: 85141935331}>, <None, {eid: 85133822936}>, <Cyber Awareness Trends in Avionics, {eid: 85083344020, doi: 10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081646}>, <From the Editors of the Special Issue on Avionics Systems: Future Challenges, {eid: 85104066398, doi: 10.1109/MAES.2021.3064616}>, <Avionics Systems Panel Research and Innovation Perspectives, {eid: 85100304293, doi: 10.1109/MAES.2020.3033475}>, <None, {eid: 85132265407}>, <None, {eid: 85141935240}>, <None, {eid: 85141934737}>, <A New Dawn for Space Security, {eid: 85141936769}>, <None, {eid: 85032496510}>, <None, {eid: 85141938442}>, <None, {eid: 84995696258}>, <Resilience of Space Systems: Principles and Practice, {eid: 85141936429}>, <None, {eid: 85141934732}>, <Satellite Cyber Resilience Whitepaper, {eid: 85141935102}>, <Defending Spacecraft in the Cyber Domain, {eid: 85101674025}>, <None, {eid: 85095355623}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-09-18,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85141935851

Therefore, ensuring the resilience of green energy infrastructure demands a distinct approach, particularly regarding the security and safety aspects of these CIs. Green Energy CIs have less inherent protection, along with ancillary protection facilities compared to conventional power plants. This underscores the need to leverage AI to enhance the safety and security of green energy infrastructures, providing efficient and cost-effective solutions. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI implementations for enhancing the security and safety of green energy. Although this study is a work in progress, the present article will specifically delve into the resilience aspects of green energy infrastructures. Given the focus on AI implementation and data-driven solutions, we approach energy systems from a cyber-physical and societal perspective, emphasizing their broader impact on society. The ongoing study has unveiled significant improvements in resilience through the application of AI methods and data-driven models, such as machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, multiagent systems, big data, and data mining. Furthermore, we explore the challenges associated with integrating AI into green energy systems and investigate its various applications. This exploration aims to identify key features that will guide the development of novel approaches to enhancing the resilience of green energy systems through AI-based solutions for security and safety. Finally, results show a significant gap in the safety applications of AI. It received the least attention in the articles While the term 'safety' is frequently mentioned, even when the article's primary focus is not on safety applications.","Critical infrastructure,

Despite its advancements, 5G encounters several challenges. To tackle these issues, global industrial, academic, and standards organizations are actively researching on sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. 6G networks are envisioned as a transformative shift in the interactions between the physical, digital, and human realms, paving the way for a pervasive human-centered cyber-physical world. 6G is positioned to be a platform that offers communication and beyond communication services considering both performance and value centric technological development approaches. In this paper, we present the way forward towards the design of 6G endto-end (E2E) system as a consolidated view of leading industry stakeholders and academia in the European level 6G flagship project Hexa-X-II. We discuss the key challenges with 5G and how 6G is expected to tackle those by introducing new technological innovations and supporting novel use case requirements. We provide a comprehensive methodology for the design of a 6G E2E system including ten principles, a blueprint, and a structured design process. The architecture design principles prioritize environmental sustainability, digital inclusiveness, and trustworthiness, considering their impact on the 6G E2E system. The blueprint is described corresponding to the infrastructure, network centric application, and application layers, as well as the pervasive functionalities and the relevant technological innovations. Following the design principles and the system blueprint, the design process is demonstrated as two-way approaches (i.e., 1) key performance and value indicators based design process. 2) top-down versus bottom-up alignment process) through the lens of a collaborative robot use case. Through this use case, a special attention is given to the technological enablers that cover management and orchestration functionalities and their 6G enhancement to go beyond the limitations characterizing the previous network generation. In addition, virtual modelling aspects related to digital twining and simulations for 6G E2E system design are also discussed.","6G, blueprint, collaborative robots, design process, end-to-end, key

Less attention has been given to the next step, i.e. challenging area of realizing new sophisticated applications that utilize the latest management capabilities brought to the table by advanced networked embedded devices, the huge amount of fine-grained data they offer and services that operate on such big data. We take a closer look here to some aspects beyond the smart metering, towards innovative value-added applications and services that take into consideration the 'Cloud of Things' ecosystem and its capabilities. We investigate how the latter impacts the development of applications and the benefits as well as challenges it brings. We also look at the role of the smart meter and the current 'war zones' among stakeholders in the residential environment, and try to shed some more light on their motivation and impact.

Moreover, techniques that make AI and ML effective, efficient, and a force multiplier within the computing domain, and the central tenets of modern AI and ML technological advancement positioning them as the future of tomorrow, need to be safeguarded against exploitation and abuse by threat actors. Based on their ubiquity, embedded use of AI and ML within industry faces a major paradox; as AI and ML technologies empower and streamline operations while providing transformative benefits to users, they simultaneously introduce formidable threats through security vulnerabilities that can cause massive damage if not defended against.

Internet of Things edge sensors and their associated data play a predominant role in today's industry ecosystem. Breaching data or forging source devices after injecting advanced persistent threats (APTs) damages the industry owners' money and loss of operators' lives. The existing challenges include APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. Edge servers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which, in essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers while transporting data using traditional public-key infrastructure-rendered trusts, consortium blockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning, edge devices can filter malicious data at their end, which largely motivates us to institute a blockchain and artificial intelligence-aligned APT detection system. The unique contributions of this article include efficient APT detection at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boosts trust among collaborators and ensures an economical and sustainable mechanism after eliminating existing certificate authority. Finally, the edge-compliant storage technique facilitates efficient predictive maintenance. The respective experimental outcomes reveal that the proposed technique outperforms the other competing systems and models.","Advanced persistent threat (APT), blockchain, deep transfer learning (DTL), edge Internet of Things (IoT), industry 4.0, IoT",,,,,,,,"<A deep blockchain framework-enabled collaborative intrusion detection for protecting IoT and cloud networks, {eid: 85107477180}>, <Enabling secure authentication in industrial IoT with transfer learning empowered blockchain, {eid: 85099229841}>, <Federated transfer learning for IIoT devices with low computing power based on blockchain and edge computing, {eid: 85110587557}>, <Blockchain-based security framework for a critical industry 4.0 cyber-physical system, {eid: 85107489196}>, <Improving EEG-based emotion classification using conditional transfer learning, {eid: 85021649987}>, <Deep transfer learning based intrusion detection system for electric vehicular networks, {eid: 85109270926}>, <GDPR-compliant personal data management: A blockchain-based solution, {eid: 85079575698}>, <Software vulnerability detection using deep neural networks: A survey, {eid: 85087092961}>, <A better method to analyze blockchain consistency, {eid: 85056853010}>, <A survey of android malware detection with deep neural models, {eid: 85100821584}>, <RapidChain: Scaling blockchain via full sharding, {eid: 85056891496}>, <Detecting internet of things attacks using distributed deep learning, {eid: 85083527952}>, <Blockchainbased incentive energy-knowledge trading in IoT: Joint power transfer and AI design, {eid: 85136105314, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2020.3024246}>, <Blockchainenabled cross-domain object detection for autonomous driving: A model sharing approach, {eid: 85083711493}>, <Toward secure data fusion in industrial IoT using transfer learning, {eid: 85097155297}>, <Privacypreserved task offloading in mobile blockchain with deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 85089294743}>, <None, {eid: 85099607262}>, <None, {eid: 85090413810}>, <Bi-level poisoning attack model and countermeasure for appliance consumption data of smart homes, {eid: 85109286626}>, <Integrating structured biological data by kernel maximum mean discrepancy, {eid: 33747886323}>, <Machine learning-based cyber attacks targeting on controlled information: A survey, {eid: 85115446698}>, <Deep learning based attack detection for cyber-physical system cybersecurity: A survey, {eid: 85115176484}>, <None, {eid: 85088097370}>, <Deep abstraction and weighted feature selection for Wi-Fi impersonation detection, {eid: 85045420000}>, <None, {eid: 28944435058}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-04-15,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85124077701

A network of such devices that can communicate with one another can aid in the realisation of a ubiquitous and pervasive computing ecosystem. If these participating devices are vehicles, then they form a particular class of mobile peer-to-peer network categorised as Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET). The devices which mainly include cars, are highly mobile thus posing numerous challenges in interdevice communication, synchronisation and sharing of data. Monitoring vehicular and battery health, movement, identification, etc. on the run are challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we describe an attempt to transform a vehicle into a mobile computing node that can host a multi-agent platform. With static agent(s) resident on these platforms and mobile agents flitting across these vehicles, we explain how a Road Side Unit (RSU) can track and obtain information about the traffic. Since these agents are autonomous pieces of static or mobile software, it is not only possible for them to obtain information about the vehicle but also gain control over it, if required. Further, since mobile agents can migrate from one vehicle to another, they possess the ability to aggregate or disseminate information on the status of the traffic. In this paper, we discuss MAVNet, a mobile agent-based framework for vehicular networks where we propose the deployment of mobile agents for data acquisition, on-board processing and sharing within a network of vehicles and the infrastructure based RSUs.

Such system integrates sensors, cameras, and other IoT connected devices to monitor parking spaces in real time. However, there are many security vulnerabilities in existing solutions, especially when it comes to car authentication at parking entry points. IoT sensors my be susceptible to Cyber-attacks and fraudulent activities, such as car theft, can exploit these vulnerabilities due to limited built-in security features. The reliability of authentication systems, based on IoT sensors can also be compromised by factors such as extreme weather conditions and physical damage. The cyber-physical solution we propose relies on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for identification and authentication in IoT devices to mitigate these challenges. The use of PUFs enhances the reliability and security of smart parking systems against unauthorized access and fraud. Furthermore, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data within the smart parking ecosystem and to improve authentication process, we propose the implementation of a tailored blockchain framework. This framework incorporates lightweight local blockchains dedicated to individual parking slots, complemented by a central blockchain that manages data at the city level. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the PUF computation process, showcasing an acceptable runtime for practical implementation. In the experimental results, we evaluated the SRAM used for the PUF implementation process and demonstrated its stability (intra HD equals to 2.25.","Internet of things, lightweight blockchain, PUF, smart parking system",,,,,,,,"<Advanced multi location IoT enabled smart car parking system with intelligent face recognition, {eid: 85193616195}>, <Fog computing-based system for decentralized smart parking system by using firebase, {eid: 85193599817}>, <Smart parking systems: Comprehensive review based on various aspects, {eid: 85105802841}>, <An IoT assisted intelligent parking system (IPS) for smart cities, {eid: 85152095830}>, <IoT based smart parking system, {eid: 85073871502}>, <A blockchain-based architecture for integrated smart parking systems, {eid: 85068004554}>, <Physical unclonable functions (PUF) for IoT devices, {eid: 85168806990}>, <Internet of Thingsenabled smart cities: State-of-the-art and future trends, {eid: 85050779998}>, <None, {eid: 85193595765}>, <Smart parking systems: Reviewing the literature, architecture and ways forward, {eid: 85118113692}>, <A lightweight blockchain and fog-enabled secure remote patient monitoring system, {eid: 85146471503}>, <Illegal parking attendants and parking (mis)management: A case study in Padang, west Sumatra, Indonesia, {eid: 85175870849}>, <Improve quality of service for the Internet of Things using blockchain & machine learning algorithms, {eid: 85188014226}>, <Blockchain reputation-based consensus: A scalable and resilient mechanism for distributed mistrusting applications, {eid: 85086727116}>, <A smart real-time parking control and monitoring system, {eid: 85180664957}>, <A social IoT-based platform for the deployment of a smart parking solution, {eid: 85123023597}>, <FPGA intrinsic PUFs and their use for IP protection, {eid: 38049015807}>, <Parkchain: A blockchain powered parking solution for smart cities, {eid: 85083583252}>, <A scalable blockchain based framework for efficient IoT data management using lightweight consensus, {eid: 85189894017}>, <An IoT raspberry pi-based parking management system for smart campus, {eid: 85114817188}>, <Cryptographie key generation from PUF data using efficient fuzzy extractors, {eid: 84898979224}>, <Implementation of blockchain technology in integrated IoT networks for constructing scalable ITS systems in India, {eid: 85191276594}>, <Multi-blockchain structure for a crowdsensing-based smart parking system, {eid: 85086080230}>, <Theory and application of majority vote: From condorcet jury theorem to pattern recognition, {eid: 85032699613}>, <A data remanence based approach to generate 100% stable keys from an SRAM physical unclonable function, {eid: 85028590529}>, <None, {eid: 85193568770}>, <Smart parking using IoT technology, {eid: 85050137109}>, <None, {eid: 85193620400}>, <A novel green IoT-based pay-as-you-go smart parking system, {eid: 85102439859}>, <None, {eid: 85099485262}>, <An in-depth insight at digital ownership through dynamic NFTs, {eid: 85146112543}>, <Methodology for developing an IoT-based parking space counter system using XNO, {eid: 85188178137}>, <Government policy in illegal parking charges at public spaces, {eid: 85175832013}>, <None, {eid: 84866023158}>, <None, {eid: 84875547656}>, <AOA based masked region-CNN model for detection of parking space in IoT environment, {eid: 85184270863}>, <BPR: Blockchain-enabled efficient and secure parking reservation framework with block size dynamic adjustment method, {eid: 85144063694}>, <Blockchain for the IoT and industrial IoT: A review, {eid: 85114988836}>, <A systematic bit selection method for robust SRAM PUFs, {eid: 85131506354}>, <Bit selection algorithm suitable for high-volume production of SRAMPUF, {eid: 84905981398}>, <A survey on smart parking systems in urban cities, {eid: 85111634401}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2024-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85192971976

As a result, the EV charging demand is continuously growing and to meet this growing demand, various types of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) are being deployed for commercial and residential use. This nexus of EVs, EVCSs, and power grids creates complex cyber-physical interdependencies that can be maliciously exploited to damage each of these components. This paper describes and analyzes cyber vulnerabilities that arise at this nexus and points to the current and emerging gaps in the security of the EV charging ecosystem. These vulnerabilities must be addressed as the number of EVs continue to grow worldwide and their impact on the power grid becomes more viable. The purpose of this paper is to list and characterize all backdoors that can be exploited to seriously harm either EV and EVCS equipments, or power grid, or both. The presented issues and challenges intend to ignite research efforts on cybersecurity of smart EV charging and enhancing power grid resiliency against such demand-side cyberattacks in

All right reserved.The innovation of software ecosystems has great influences on the production style of IT industry. It refactors the business ecosystems of IT industry. Academic and industry researchers have paid close attention to software ecosystems since 2003. Some world-wide famous IT companies make efforts towards achieving their own software ecosystems. As has developed to numerous examples of software ecosystems. Currently, emerging information technologies (such as cloud computing, mobile application development, cyber-physical systems, blockchains) are applied deeply and widely in the field of software ecosystems. The application of software ecosystems has become more and more intensive in various industries and domains. The definition of a software ecosystem has changed greatly over time. In order to clarify the context of a software ecosystem, researchers adopt biological ecosystem theories, and propose several different kinds of definitions for software ecosystems. It is not until the year of 2016 that there is consensus on what a software ecosystem is. A software ecosystem refers to a complex system in which the software and its related stakeholders interact intensively within a common technological infrastructure. In the paper, we adopt biological ecosystem theories to the context so as to come out a meta-model of software ecosystems which forms the basis for the discussion of the issues relating to software ecosystems. The meta-model, which is presented in UML class diagram, describes the key building blocks and key characteristics of software ecosystems. Typically, the research results of papers in the field of software ecosystems are compared to traditional classification which was presented in 2003. The traditional classification includes seven categories: (1) procedure or technique; (2) qualitative or descriptive model; (3) analytic model; (4) empirical model; (5) tool or notation; (6) specific solution, prototype, answer, or judgment; (7) report. But, the traditional classification schema has to be revised because that the context and the key characteristics of software ecosystems have changed greatly over time. According to our observations, we find that the combination of quantity and quality analysis is always adopted in the field, and that empirical studies reporting specific solutions for software ecosystems are in fashion. We make minor changes to the traditional classification schema for the papers focusing on software ecosystems, and then propose a five-classification pattern. Our five-classification schema combines ""qualitative or descriptive model"" and ""analytic model"" to produce a new category namely ""analytic method or framework"", and integrate ""specific solution, prototype, answer, or judgment"" into ""empirical study"". The meta-model as well as the five-classification schema forms the basis for the discussions of the issues relating to software ecosystems. Then, we provide a literal review of the research in the filed from 2015 until 2017. In total, the literature counts 196 papers. Our literature review is based on the keywords, the abstract, publication source, research content. We category the research results of papers into our five-category schema, and then identify the recent development and progress in the field. However, there exists a set of challenges for future research. Those challenges includes requirements engineering, architecture modeling, model-driven development, power mechanisms, feature analysis, information content analysis, ecologic network analysis, impact analysis of defect and/or bad smell, tool supports, emerging applications for software ecosystems.","Ecological system structure, Meta-model, Software ecosystems, Taxonomy schema",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0037944013}>, <Revisiting software ecosystems research: A longitudinal literature study, {eid: 84960154891}>, <Towards a typification of software ecosystems, {eid: 84937400084}>, <Software ecosystems for the life sciences application domains, {eid: 85083274565}>, <Preliminary validation of the metamodel for developing learning ecosystems, {eid: 85038601170}>, <The ecology of software ecosystems, {eid: 84959423398}>, <Engineering roles for constructing ecosystems, {eid: 85056891124}>, <The architects role in software ecosystems health, {eid: 85037746132}>, <Challenges in software ecosystems research, {eid: 85013062290}>, <A roadmap for cloud SECO: EcoData and the new actors in IoT era, {eid: 84945933772}>, <Ecosystems and open innovation for embedded systems: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 84937424455}>, <Mobile Software Ecosystem (MSECO): A systematic mapping study, {eid: 84962182356}>, <Mobile software security threats in the software ecosystem, a call to arms, {eid: 85034233876}>, <Quo vadis cyber-physical systems: Research areas of cyber-physical ecosystems: A position paper, {eid: 84960352275}>, <Open source software and its ecosystems: Today and tomorrow, {eid: 85053841491}>, <Free and open source software development: The end of the teenage years, {eid: 85037327963}>, <Open source software ecosystems: A systematic mapping, {eid: 85025476436}>, <Scientists needs in modelling software ecosystems, {eid: 85027903055}>, <A survey of modeling approaches for software ecosystems, {eid: 84976635039}>, <Wealthy, Healthy and/or Happy-What does ecosystem health stand for?, {eid: 84937434086}>, <Ecosystems here, there, and everywhere: A barometrical analysis of the roots of software ecosystem, {eid: 84976639801}>, <Software ecosystems architectural health: Challenges x practices, {eid: 85026346071}>, <How has the health of software ecosystems been evaluated?

This issue becomes even more challenging when the concept of CPS is exploited to propose cyber-physical machines and manufacturing systems, where the complexity of the controlling intelligence and of the digital counterpart explodes. As a matter of fact, the market behind CPS has a potential that is still scarcely supported by methodologies and tools able to foster the rise of a solid ecosystem required for a relevant market uptake. Multi-sided platforms (MSPs) have demonstrated to play the pivotal role of providing the environments and the technological infrastructures able to match make the needs of manifold user insisting on them. The manufacturing sector did not remain untouched by this trend and moves its first step towards the integration of platform logics across value networks: the CPS business ecosystem is one of those. In this chapter, beyond an analysis of the current state of the automation value network, the design and implementation of a multi-sided platform for CPS deployment within the automation sector are described. The proposed platform can provide the infrastructure to incentivize CPS adoption, creating the technological and value drivers supporting the transition towards new paradigms for the development of the software components of a mechatronic system. Developing an infrastructure on the top of which the CPS value network can be instantiated and orchestrated, the proposed platform provides the technical means to incentivize the creation of an ecosystem able to support especially SMEs in their transition towards Industry 4.0.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 33846869561}>, <Percepcao dos usuarios sobre os atributos de uma inovacao, {eid: 84869818223}>, <Ensino de inovacao na formacao do administrador brasileiro: Contribuicoes para gestores de curso, {eid: 85052509234}>, <None, {eid: 84876819524}>, <None, {eid: 85106618322}>, <The context for change:Organization, technology and environment, {eid: 3943076943}>, <Innovation management in context: Environment, organization and performance, {eid: 0035645142}>, <None, {eid: 0004083224}>, <The Effect of Dynamic Capability to Technology Adoption and its Determinant Factors for Improving Firm’s Performance; Toward a Conceptual Model, {eid: 85013873442}>, <None, {eid: 85077049470}>, <Mapping out the sharing economy: A configurational approach to sharing business modeling, {eid: 85017154235}>, <IEC 61499 as Enabler of Distributed and Intelligent Automation: State-of-the-Art Review, {eid: 81255138946}>, <IEC 61131-3 control applications vs. control applications transformed in IEC 61499, {eid: 80051973517}>, <Integration of Classical Components Into Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 84964264756}>, <Design of a multi-sided platform supporting CPS deployment in the automation market, {eid: 85050144169}>, <Integrating agent based simulation in the design of multi-sided platform business model?:A methodological approach, {eid: 85052507819}>, <Platform Dynamics and Strategies: From Products to Services, {eid: 84913550517}>, <Industry Platform and Ecosystem Innovation, {eid: 84898004011}>",,,River Publishers,,,2019-01-15,,,,,,,eng,,Book,,,,2-s2.0-85106573903

We performed an online survey of software engineers with software integration experiences to identify the main difficulties of performing interoperability analysis. The results confirm that the state of available practical support and current input artifacts used during the analysis are significantly perceived as important difficulties. Respondents claim a lack of guidelines and best practices for applying interoperability analysis and claim insufficiency of shared information about interoperable software units. This indicates the need for providing directive and rigorous guidelines for practitioners to follow and to enrich the content of shared documents about interoperable software units.","Conceptual interoperability, Interoperability analysis, Survey",,,,,,,,"<A proactive support for conceptual interoperability analysis in software systems, {eid: 84943329814}>, <None, {eid: 85025467982}>, <None, {eid: 0026226965}>, <A framework for intelligent assessment and resolution of commercial-off-the-shelf product incompatibilities, {eid: 85025450820}>, <COTS integration: Plug and pray?, {eid: 85008025059}>, <Composable process elements for developing COTS-based applications, {eid: 84944326868}>, <None, {eid: 84871782260}>, <None, {eid: 84878658923}>, <Internet, mail, and mixed-mode surveys: The tailored design method, {eid: 85025465273}>, <None, {eid: 0141553453}>, <None, {eid: 0004125329}>, <None, {eid: 62949143133}>, <None, {eid: 0026873608}>, <None, {eid: 56649095145}>, <None, {eid: 85025432498}>, <None, {eid: 0003925451}>, <None, {eid: 85025430360}>, <Goal question metric (GQM) approach, {eid: 84867458123}>, <Wilcoxon signed-rank test, {eid: 84891735487}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2017-06-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85025432461

Many CPSs have useful lifetimes measured in decades. This leads to unique concerns regarding security and longevity of software designed for CPSs which are exacerbated by the need for CPSs to adapt to ecosystem changes if they are to remain functional over extended periods. In particular, the software in long-lifetime CPSs must adapt to unanticipated trends in environmental conditions, aging effects on mechanical systems, and component upgrades and modifications. This paper presents the Toolkit for Evolving Ecosystem Envelopes (TEEE) system created to help address these challenges in CPSs. TEEE is able to detect environmental changes which have caused errors within the CPS without directly sensing the environmental change. TEEE uses dynamic profiling to detect the errors within the CPS, determine the root cause of the error, alert the user, and suggest a possible adaption.","Cyber-Physical systems, Requirements-based testing, Resilient systems",,,,,,,,"<Cloud-ATAM : Method for analysing resilient attributes of cloud-based architectures, {eid: 84992695169, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-45892-28}>, <Test case prioritization using requirements-based clustering, {eid: 84883402003}>, <Specification-based regression test selection with risk analysis, {eid: 24944502842}>, <None, {eid: 84856557790}>, <The AETG system: An approach to testing based on combinatorial design, {eid: 0000673732}>, <Compositional falsification of cyber-physical systems with machine learning components, {eid: 85018721707, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-57288-826}>, <The SAE avionics architecture description language (AADL) standard: A basis for model-based architecture-driven embedded systems, {eid: 27944477471}>, <None, {eid: 34548836760}>, <An evaluation of combination strategies for test case selection, {eid: 34548122473}>, <Building resource adaptive software systems (Brass): Objectives and system evaluation.

The associated activities can be complex and labour-intensive, thus practitioners need suitable means to execute them. The activities are further becoming more challenging as a result of the evolution of the systems towards cyber-physical ones, as these systems have new assurance and certification needs. The AMASS project (Architecture-driven, Multi-concern and Seamless Assurance and Certification of Cyber-Physical Systems) tackled these issues by creating and consolidating the de-facto European-wide open tool platform, ecosystem, and self-sustainable community for assurance and certification of cyber-physical systems. The project defined a novel holistic approach for architecture-driven assurance, multi-concern assurance, seamless interoperability, and cross- and intra-domain reuse of assurance assets. AMASS results were applied in 11 industrial case studies to demonstrate the reduction of effort in assurance and certification, the reduction of (re)certification cost, the reduction of assurance and certification risks, and the increase in technology harmonisation and interoperability.","AMASS, Assurance, Certification, CPS, Cyber-physical system",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85053936684}>, <None, {eid: 85076566907}>, <None, {eid: 85076552851}>, <None, {eid: 85076576829}>, <None, {eid: 85076568330}>, <None, {eid: 85076535905}>, <None, {eid: 85076522596}>, <None, {eid: 85076552542}>, <None, {eid: 85076529876}>, <None, {eid: 85076527476}>, <None, {eid: 85053937999}>, <None, {eid: 84883203407}>, <None, {eid: 85076578461}>, <None, {eid: 85018719226}>, <The AMASS approach for assurance and certification of critical systems, {eid: 85072884518}>, <Meet the new eclipse-based tools for assurance and certification of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85076539888}>, <None, {eid: 85076510003}>, <An extended systematic literature review on provision of evidence for safety certification, {eid: 84898825068}>, <None, {eid: 85076529297}>, <None, {eid: 85076572449}>, <None, {eid: 85076550836}>, <None, {eid: 85064042192}>, <None, {eid: 85076547887}>, <None, {eid: 85076531185}>, <Architecture-driven, multi-concern, seamless, reuse-oriented assurance and certification of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85076545160}>, <None, {eid: 84889905955}>, <None, {eid: 85076572537}>, <None, {eid: 85076575511}>",,,Springer,,,2019-11-27,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85076563257

VPs are predominantly created in SystemC transaction-level modeling (TLM) and are leveraged for early software development and other system-level use cases. Recently, virtual prototyping has been introduced for the emerging RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) and become an important piece of the growing RISC-V ecosystem. In this paper, we present enhanced virtual prototyping solutions tailored for RISC-V. The foundation is an advanced open source RISC-V VP implemented in SystemC TLM and designed as a configurable and extensible platform. It scales from small bare-metal systems to large multi-core systems that run applications on top of the Linux operating system. Based on the RISC-V VP, this paper also discusses advanced VP-based verification approaches and open challenges. In combination, we provide for the first time an integrated and unified overview and perspective on advanced virtual prototyping for RISC-V.","RISC-V, SystemC TLM, verification, virtual

We look at the development of these fields, and identify fundamental properties for building future elastic systems. We further envision a new field of research: Elastic Computing.

However, value creation may experience challenges due to bias formed during public-private innovation ecosystem genesis. This empirical study of bias in a new pan-European public-private initiative provides results regarding innovation ecosystems and the individuals typically active during their genesis: value creation is biased towards the selection of incumbent firms and complement challenges, and participation is biased towards engineers with knowledge of exploitation from multiple domains and researchers with knowledge of exploitation from single domains. This suggests that the implications of the loose coupling emphasised by the innovation ecosystems discourse and the knowledge of the different contexts in which firms capture value are more complex than previously acknowledged. The practical implications are that the ability of public innovation ecosystem leadership to act early on novel technology might be offset by the inability of involved firms to commit to bringing the technology to market and that individuals typically active during public-private innovation ecosystems genesis are not ideal for handling this challenge. In fact, increasingly connected public leadership could smother the innovation ecosystem unless well-connected and multidisciplinary researchers are brought in as brokers.","Application domains, Cyber-physical systems, Ecosystem genesis, Innovation ecosystems, Loose coupling, Public-private cooperation",,,,,,,,"<Value creation in innovation ecosystems: how the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations, {eid: 77449110302}>, <How much do your co‐opetitors capabilities matter in the face of technological change?, {eid: 0001267275}>, <Crowdsourcing as a solution to distant search, {eid: 84862552217}>, <Inference for Contingency Tables, {eid: 26444477556}>, <Do government R&D subsidies stimulate collaboration initiatives in private firms?, {eid: 85075759925}>, <Universities–industry collaboration: a systematic review, {eid: 84938744100}>, <Innovation ecosystems: implications for innovation management?, {eid: 84926228465}>, <The architecture of platforms: a unified view, {eid: 71949126345}>, <Acquiring external knowledge: how much overlap is best?, {eid: 84938954305}>, <In defense of engineering sciences: on the epistemological relations between science and technology, {eid: 84863528946}>, <On network theory, {eid: 82255167609}>, <Platform rules: multi-sided platforms as regulators, {eid: 77958062188}>, <EN 50129 Railway Applications - Communication, Signalling and Processing Systems - Safety Related Electronics Systems For Signalling, {eid: 33144462456}>, <Exploration and exploitation in the development of more entrepreneurial universities: a twisting learning path model of ambidexterity, {eid: 85057067632}>, <Explaining the attackers advantage: technological paradigms, organizational dynamics, and the value network, {eid: 33750558799}>, <Creating value in ecosystems: crossing the chasm between knowledge and business ecosystems, {eid: 84902545568}>, <Absorptive capacity: a new perspective on learning and innovation, {eid: 84936166194}>, <None, {eid: 85092373998}>, <The academic profession and the role of the service function, {eid: 84940723310}>, <Maneuvering in poor visibility: how firms play the ecosystem game when uncertainty is high, {eid: 85036553512}>, <Roles during innovation ecosystem genesis: a literature review, {eid: 85028071919}>, <Birth and expansion of innovation ecosystems: a case study of copper production, {eid: 84944446211}>, <Technological paradigms and technological trajectories: a suggested interpretation of the determinants and directions of technical change, {eid: 0012651592}>, <Checking the Straight Line Fit, {eid: 0003656150}>, <ECSS-Q-ST-40C Space Product Assurance, Safety, {eid: 84992524629}>, <Innovation in innovation: the triple helix of university-industry-government relations, {eid: 0041325264}>, <None, {eid: 85092381922}>, <None, {eid: 85092420528}>, <None, {eid: 85092402878}>, <Living in a Networked world: Integrated research Agenda Cyber-Physical Systems (agendaCPS), {eid: 84974636191}>, <Unpacking the innovation ecosystem construct: evolution, gaps and trends, {eid: 85053249323}>, <The strength of weak ties, {eid: 34247960076}>, <Dealing with legitimacy: a key challenge for Project Portfolio Management decision makers, {eid: 84887249245}>, <When are assets complementary?

One of the resulting challenges of this evolution is the increased need for interoperability at different levels of the manufacturing ecosystem. The scope ranges from shop-floor software, devices, and control systems to Internet-based cloud-platforms, providing various services on-demand. Successful implementation of interoperability in smart manufacturing would, thus, result in effective communication and error-prone data-exchange between machines, sensors, actuators, users, systems, and platforms. A significant challenge to this is the architecture and the platforms that are used by machines and software packages. A better understanding of the subject can be achieved by studying industry-specific communication protocols and their respective logical semantics. A review of research conducted in this area is provided in this article to gain perspective on the various dimensions and types of interoperability. This article provides a multi-faceted approach to the research area of interoperability by reviewing key concepts and existing research efforts in the domain, as well as by discussing challenges and solutions.","Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, Internet of things, Interoperability, Smart manufacturing",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85019122999}>, <None, {eid: 84990825420}>, <None, {eid: 85069040381}>, <Reference architectures for smart manufacturing: A critical review, {eid: 85056448761}>, <None, {eid: 84994464585}>, <Cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84990841502}>, <From cloud computing to cloud manufacturing, {eid: 80052032966}>, <Manufacturing interoperability, {eid: 33751509359}>, <Cyber Physical Systems: Design Challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <None, {eid: 85029602140}>, <The Internet of Things and convenience, {eid: 84961589980}>, <CCIoT-CMfg: Cloud Computing and Internet of Things-Based Cloud Manufacturing Service System, {eid: 84896931467}>, <None, {eid: 85044552260}>, <None, {eid: 85069044928}>, <Machine learning in manufacturing: Advantages, challenges, and applications, {eid: 84995968996}>, <Data Mining in Manufacturing: A Review, {eid: 33751110224}>, <The Smart Factory: Exploring Adaptive and Flexible Manufacturing Solutions, {eid: 84899105439}>, <Current status and advancement of cyber-physical systems in manufacturing, {eid: 84928606583}>, <Introduction to cyber manufacturing, {eid: 84968820897}>, <Industry 4.0 and the current status as well as future prospects on logistics, {eid: 85018499538}>, <Cloud-based design and manufacturing: A new paradigm in digital manufacturing and design innovation, {eid: 84906832119}>, <Towards a cyber-physical-social-connected and service-oriented manufacturing paradigm: Social Manufacturing, {eid: 84953407073}>, <None, {eid: 85069042491}>, <None, {eid: 70349737164}>, <None, {eid: 51749118528}>, <None, {eid: 66149130951}>, <Sandra Semantic interoperability, {eid: 84976797692}>, <None, {eid: 85069045590}>, <None, {eid: 85069036555}>, <Interoperability in Collaborative Networks: Independent and industry-specific initiatives-The case of the footwear industry, {eid: 44649155617}>, <None, {eid: 24944493383}>, <None, {eid: 84904364571}>, <None, {eid: 85069054769}>, <None, {eid: 77954551227}>, <None, {eid: 84873059539}>, <Semantic Interoperability in Practice, {eid: 77951740435}>, <The Semantic Web: The roles of XML and RDF, {eid: 0034273774}>, <Interoperability of the Time of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things, {eid: 85061197750}>, <None, {eid: 0003963655}>, <Architectures for enterprise integration and interoperability: Past, present and future, {eid: 47049121707}>, <None, {eid: 85069054480}>, <None, {eid: 85069054083}>, <None, {eid: 85015218554}>, <Interoperability as a Key Enabler for Manufacturing in the Cloud, {eid: 84992664004}>, <None, {eid: 85151562404}>, <Development of a Hybrid Manufacturing Cloud, {eid: 84919463064}>, <New Generation Artificial Intelligence-Driven Intelligent Manufacturing (NGAIIM), {eid: 85060296088}>, <INDICS: An Industrial Internet Platform, {eid: 85053373695}>, <None, {eid: 0003924046}>, <None, {eid: 85069051489}>, <None, {eid: 85060987392}>, <None, {eid: 85069056557}>, <None, {eid: 85016024614}>, <One step towards an industry 4.0 component, {eid: 85044971481}>, <AutomationML-The glue for seamless automation engineering, {eid: 56349149489}>, <None, {eid: 85069057431}>",,,MDPI AG,,,2019-06-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85069037030

Such ecosystems demand smart CPSs that continuously align their architecture and governance to the concerns of various stakeholders, including developers, operators, and users. In order to satisfy short- and long-term stakeholder concerns in a continuously evolving operational context, this work proposes self-adaptive software models that promote DevOps for smart CPS. Our architectural approach extends to the embedded system layer and utilizes embedded and interconnected Digital Twins to manage change effectively. Experiments conducted on industrial embedded control units demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness in achieving sub-millisecond real-time closed-loop control of CPS assets and the simultaneous high-fidelity twinning (i.e., monitoring) of asset states. In addition, the experiments show practical support for the adaptation and evolution of CPS through the dynamic reconfiguring and updating of real-time control services and communication links without downtime. The evaluation results conclude that, in particular, the embedded Digital Twins can enhance CPS smartness by providing service-oriented access to CPS data, monitoring, adaptation, and control capabilities. Furthermore, the embedded Digital Twins can facilitate the seamless integration of these capabilities into current and future industrial service ecosystems. At the same time, these capabilities contribute to implementing emerging industrial services such as remote asset monitoring, commissioning, and maintenance.","CPS, DevOps, Digital Twin, distributed

Interoperability among devices and machines is one of the challenges. Sensors, components and machines from different vendors work as independent silos offering large amounts of heterogeneous data which relational capabilities are not fully exploited. Quick development, deployment and testing of new software solutions that take advantage of those data is another important matter. The requirements in terms of equipment resources and engineering efforts is high when planning new implementations. Platforms that enable the efficient application of those solutions at the right level (machine, edge, plant or cloud) are also necessary.(p)(/p)This paper presents an industrial case study on the application of the Arrowhead framework. The framework is implemented in the Machine Tooling ecosystem and enables the integration of grinding machines with other sensors, components or machines. Different software engineering tools offered with Arrowhead are used to design new solutions in Cyber-Physical System and Internet of Things in Industry 4.0 and make them Arrowhead compliant, for fast deployment of platforms and applications (Dockers) or for testing purposes (Management tool). Finally, the potential of agile construction of new applications is analysed by providing an Human-Machine Interface at machine level and the provision of services for data consumption at cloud level.","Arrowhead, Cyber-Physical System, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things",,,,,,,,"<(smart cps) an internet-of-things (iot) based cyber manufacturing framework for the assembly of microdevices, {eid: 85064537008}>, <Iot powered servitization of manufacturing-an exploratory case study, {eid: 85015303829}>, <Fog computing and its role in the internet of things, {eid: 84866627419}>, <Analysis of technological architectures for the new paradigm of the industry 4. 0, {eid: 85086037916}>, <Strategic r&d opportunities for 21st century cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84885811607}>, <Smart servitization within the context of industrial user-supplier relationships: Contingencies according to a machine tool manufacturer, {eid: 84980030824}>, <Interoperability for industrial cyber-physical systems: An approach for legacy systems, {eid: 85028505206}>, <Co-simulation of cyber physical systems with hmi for human in the loop investigations, {eid: 85020638432}>, <Edge-cloud orchestration driven industrial smart product-service systems solution design based on cps and iiot, {eid: 85072256748}>, <Cps (cyber physical system) based manufacturing system optimization, {eid: 85040308175}>, <Big data for cyber physical systems in industry 4. 0: A survey, {eid: 85042909694}>, <Summarisation and relevance evaluation techniques for big data exploration: The smart factory case study, {eid: 85021216074}>, <Scalability analysis comparisons of cloudbased software services, {eid: 85069539990}>, <None, {eid: 85181385491}>, <Internet of things in industries: A survey, {eid: 84906834039}>, <None, {eid: 85092433848}>, <The internet of things vision: Key features, applications and open issues, {eid: 84915801700}>, <Internet of things reference architectures, security and interoperability: A survey, {eid: 85057160902}>, <Emerging technologies: Iot, big data, and cps with sensory systems, {eid: 85043372523}>, <Experience based knowledge representation for internet of things and cyber physical systems with case studies, {eid: 85041998745}>, <A constraint mining approach to support monitoring cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85067358156}>, <A game-theoretic approach to cross-layer security decision-making in industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85074682384}>, <On the safety of iot device physical interaction control, {eid: 85056864669}>, <The relevance of software documentation, tools and technologies: A survey, {eid: 0141650592}>, <Semi-automatic ontology-driven development documentation: Generating documents from rdf data and dita templates, {eid: 85065672913}>, <Emulation-in-the-loop for simulation and testing of realtime critical cps, {eid: 85050107971}>, <A learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration development and testing practice, {eid: 85056634616}>, <Modeldriven automated deployment of large-scale cps co-simulations in the cloud, {eid: 85041450565}>, <Orchestration of microservices for iot using docker and edge computing, {eid: 85053467724}>, <A modular cps architecture design based on ros and docker, {eid: 84964196260}>, <None, {eid: 84971519599}>, <None, {eid: 84874429477}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2020-10-19,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85097802020

Published by Elsevier B.V.More and more elements in a modern production system are becoming smart devices and it is reasonable to integrate them into a Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS) in a consistent manner. There is the broad goal of many industrial players to open the rich potential of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which has to be fast, secure and adaptive. The growing number of ""things"" in a production system requires satisfying connectivity solutions that are different to an easy coming ""Peer-to-Peer architecture (P2P)"". The approach followed at the smartfactory@tugraz - the Learning Factory of Graz University of Technology in Austria - to achieve such an integration is to deploy an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), which is at the core of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The goal is to integrate three main software applications including the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and the Management Execution System (MES). The additional challenge in this project is that these mentioned main applications are all provided by different suppliers. The selected SOA approach provides the basis for a scalable and extensible solution via Connectivity Modules and standardized interfaces. The smartfactory@tugraz validates this SOA approach by applying it to a real and fully operational manufacturing line. The smartfactory@tugraz is not only a learning factory but rather an open ecosystem by offering both students and researchers as well as industrial partners the ability to perform research on this subject. It is thus the ideal place to study the challenges and to understand the benefits of pushing a CPPS to a mature level in terms of connectivity in a manufacturing context.","Connectivity, CPPS, ESB, OPC UA, Peer-to-peer architecture (P2P), Reference architecture, Service oriented architecture, Smart Factory, SOA Enterprise Service Bus",,,,,,,,"<Enterprise Architectures for the Digital Transformation in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, {eid: 85044637997}>, <Forschungsraum smartfactory@tugraz - Die Sichtbarmachung einer agilen Fertigung, {eid: 85065645479}>, <A critical review of smart manufacturing & Industry 4.0, {eid: 85055904167}>, <None, {eid: 85042671846}>, <None, {eid: 85065647748}>, <SOA and Web Services Interface Design, {eid: 85014273181}>, <Architecting Scalable Enterprise Web Applications, {eid: 85065660830}>, <None, {eid: 33744509965}>, <None, {eid: 85065665480}>, <Enterprise Service Bus, {eid: 85065635720}>, <Loose Coupling, {eid: 85065642717}>, <Whats in a Service?, {eid: 36749076301}>, <None, {eid: 85047244766}>, <None, {eid: 85065658338}>, <None, {eid: 85048818555}>, <Anwendungsbeispiele zur Integration heterogener Steuerungssysteme bei robotergestützten Industrieanlagen, {eid: 85068473205}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2019-03-26,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85065662522

Those opportunities make them interesting for scalable and secure IoT deployments. WebAssembly is an application virtual machine with origins in web browsers, that is getting rapidly adopted in other domains. The strong and steadily growing ecosystem makes WebAssembly an interesting candidate for Embedded Systems. This position paper discusses the usage of WebAssembly in Embedded Systems. After introducing the basic concepts of WebAssembly and existing runtime environments, we give an overview of the challenges for the efficient usage of WebAssembly in Embedded Systems. The paper concludes with a real world case study that demonstrates the viability, before giving an outlook on open issues and upcoming work.","embedded systems, interpreter, portability, runtime, webassembly",,,,,,,,"<Challenges for embedded software development, {eid: 51449124054}>, <None, {eid: 0003848372}>, <A Java processor architecture for embedded real-time systems, {eid: 42949092270}>, <None, {eid: 85039155879}>, <Bringing the web up to speed with webassembly, {eid: 85025171948}>, <None, {eid: 85133979459}>, <None, {eid: 85071733146}>, <None, {eid: 85133963377}>, <None, {eid: 85133976055}>, <None, {eid: 85133974026}>, <None, {eid: 85098610281}>, <None, {eid: 85133973906}>, <None, {eid: 85133963457}>, <None, {eid: 84947062406}>, <None, {eid: 85133954350}>, <None, {eid: 85133977715}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-06-07,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85133954947

This paper systematically identifies peer-reviewed literature and explicitly investigates empirical primary studies that address cyber resilience and digital forensic incident response (DFIR) aspects of cyber–physical systems (CPSs) in smart cities. Our findings show that CPSs addressing cyber resilience and support for modern DFIR are a recent paradigm. Most of the primary studies are focused on a subset of the incident response process, the “detection and analysis” phase whilst attempts to address other parts of the DFIR process remain limited. Further analysis shows that research focused on smart healthcare and smart citizen were addressed only by a small number of primary studies. Additionally, our findings identify a lack of available real CPS-generated datasets limiting the experiments to mostly testbed type environments or in some cases authors relied on simulation software. Therefore, contributing this systematic literature review (SLR), we used a search protocol providing an evidence-based summary of the key themes and main focus domains investigating cyber resilience and DFIR addressed by CPS frameworks and systems. This SLR also provides scientific evidence of the gaps in the literature for possible future directions for research within the CPS cybersecurity realm. In total, 600 papers were surveyed from which 52 primary studies were included and analysed.","Critical national infrastructure, Cyber–physical systems, Digital citizens, Energy, Healthcare, Mobility,

Smart places (cities, districts, neighbourhoods, ecosystems) depend on the way digitalisation disrupts systems of innovation in cities, making it more open, global, participatory and experimental. We argue that the rise and interconnection of various types of intelligence (artificial, human, collective) could bring profound changes in the way smart places are being created and evolve. In this context, cyber-physical systems of innovation are deployed through multiple nodes acquiring digital companions, collaboration is deployed over physical, social, and digital spaces, and actors can use complex methods guided by software and get insights from data and analytics. The paper also presents the case study of OnlineS3, a two-year Horizon 2020 project, which developed and tested a digital platform composed of applications, datasets and roadmaps, which altogether create a digital environment for empowering the design of smart specialisation strategies for local and regional systems of innovation. The results indicate that digital transformation allows the operationalisation of multiple methodologies which have not been used earlier by policy makers, due to lack of capabilities. It can also increase the scalability of indicators facilitating decision making at different spatial scales and, therefore, better respond to the complexity of innovation systems providing dynamic and scale-diverse information.","Co-creation, Data-intelligence, Digital platforms, Digitalisation, Intelligent cities, Smart cities, Systems of innovation",,,,,,,,"<Assessing the Impacts of Public Participation: Concepts, Evidence and Policy Implications, {eid: 63149091266}>, <The Promise of Idea Crowdsourcing–Benefits, Contexts, Limitations, {eid: 84871151095}>, <Schumpeters core works revisited, {eid: 85030993582}>, <Digital services in knowledge cities: the case of digital Thermi, {eid: 84870280124}>, <Enhancing sustainable urban development through smart city applications, {eid: 85037038522}>, <City-as-a-platform: the rise of participatory innovation platforms in Finnish cities, {eid: 84990929573}>, <Modeling a paradigm shift: from producer innovation to user and open collaborative innovation, {eid: 79959828986}>, <Service innovation in the digital age: key contributions and future directions, {eid: 84938680758}>, <Crowdsourcing new product ideas over time: an analysis of the Dell IdeaStorm community, {eid: 84874138644}>, <Evolutionary Governance Theory, {eid: 84943415572}>, <Beyond engagement and participation: user and community coproduction of public services, {eid: 34548857626}>, <Race against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy, {eid: 84861165653}>, <Knowledge based policy making, {eid: 84968783857}>, <‘MOde 3’andQuadruple Helix’: toward a 21st century fractal innovation ecosystem, {eid: 60849132212}>, <The quadruple/quintuple innovation helixes and smart specialisation strategies for sustainable and inclusive growth in Europe and beyond, {eid: 84901200281}>, <Towards a systematic exploitation of web 2.0 and simulation modeling tools in public policy process, {eid: 78049346116}>, <A descriptive model of online shopping process: some empirical results, {eid: 0344118133}>, <Open Innovation.

These systems are exemplified by advanced mechatronics systems, embedded control systems, real-time systems, agent-based smart systems, distributed software systems, internet of things systems, and cyber-physical systems. The objective of this paper is to offer an initial cataloguing of the various research domains and to identify the major research issues. The paper has an ontological flavour, because it concentrates on what research has been and is being done, rather than on why and how research is done. The underpinning study has been done in three stages: (i) intuition-driven exploration of a reference set of related academic publications, (ii) evidence-based specification of a categorization of the domains and subdomains of research, and (iii) refinement and validation of the proposed classification based on a control set of related academic publications. The proposed reasoning model identifies three categories of research domains. The ‘intellectualizations’ category includes research domains such as: (i) philosophy, (ii) ontology, and (iii) epistemology of CTSs. The research domains included in the ‘realizations’ category are: (iv) methodology, and (v) creation of CTSs. The domains considered in the ‘influences’ category are: (vi) manifestations, and (vii) axiology of CTSs. Based on the proposed reasoning model a landscape of foundational research in CTSs is proposed for public debate. Our follow-up study focuses on the extension of the proposed classification to other families of complex engineered systems such as sociotechnical systems and social ecosystems.","Complex technical

All rights reserved.The impact of what is known as high technology, which is based on cyber-physical systems that, first and foremost, combine physic infrastructure with software, sensors, nanotechnology and digital technology of communication, sets the different ways of communicative mediation in a new setting. Cybernation has entered the communicative ecosystem and is becoming more and more prominent, which reshapes the models of infomediation (understood as mediation and intermediation) and demands renewed technological competences and skills to the professional profiles of information and communication. In this paper, the context of the technological development in the field of communication is, preferably, analized from the digital origin. The starting point is situated for this new panorama which, parallel to smart automation, can be foreseen for infomediation. Some of the main challenges that are distinguished in the immediate scenario for the professional mediators are also identified.","Communication, Communicative mediation, High technology applied to communication, Infomediation, Network society, Skills, Smart automation, Technologies",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84953299037}>, <None, {eid: 0003708603}>, <None, {eid: 0003855980}>, <El nuevo ecosistema mediático, {eid: 84938945686}>, <From mass to networked communication: Communicational models and the Informational Society, {eid: 79959776068}>, <None, {eid: 84943299745}>, <None, {eid: 0003976021}>, <None, {eid: 0003446085}>, <None, {eid: 4344647334}>, <Creatividad, innovación y cultura digital.

Putting the light on Europe, the key priorities for manufacturing are aligned with the Industry 4.0 strategy/program where the proliferation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and technologies like predictive data analytics, cloud and edge computing are creating the foundation for smart factory, i.e. the efficient and effective connection between products, processes and their related services. However, even if the smart factory vision is quite clear, in practice, it is still unclear how it can be implemented in a way to allow the transparent data exchange between all the layers of a manufacturing company, as well as, between the manufacturing company and the value chain partners. Within the German Industrie4.0 program, the Asset Administration Shell concept is defined to create a standardized digital representation of the asset while ensuring interoperability between all the applications within the manufacturing ecosystem. In this paper, an implementation of the asset administration shell is provided - also called NOVAAS - based on the deep usage of internet technologies, languages and software engineering techniques and methods (such as DevOps, microservices, continuous integration, etc.). The main goal is to contribute towards a generic and extensible reference implementation of the concept.","Asset administration shell, Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, interoperability, RAMI 4.0",,,,,,,,"<Smart factory systems, {eid: 84929950324}>, <None, {eid: 84906929599}>, <Product-service systems engineering: State of the art and research challenges, {eid: 84860731929}>, <None, {eid: 85064053524}>, <Service innovation and smart analytics for industry 4.0 and big data environment, {eid: 84905408361}>, <Semantic communication between components for smart factories based on oneM2M, {eid: 85044442732}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <None, {eid: 85048106114}>, <None, {eid: 85083980194}>, <None, {eid: 85083991773}>, <None, {eid: 85083969208}>, <Enhancing device exchange agility in Service-oriented industrial automation, {eid: 84881640235}>, <An agent based framework to support plug and produce, {eid: 84914145650}>, <The PRIME semantic language: Plug and produce in standard- based manufacturing production systems, {eid: 85014932952}>, <Internet of things applications in future manufacturing, {eid: 85042120718}>, <Towards a framework for interoperable and interconnected CPS-populated systems for proactive maintenance, {eid: 85055493904}>, <Integrated data model and structure for the asset administration shell in industrie 4.0, {eid: 85019991137}>, <GO0DMAN data model - Interoperability in multistage zero defect manufacturing, {eid: 85055499910}>, <Enabling security and safety evaluation in industry 4.0 use cases with digital twins, {eid: 85083990591}>, <Extended semantic annotations for generating translators in the arrowhead framework, {eid: 85038831759}>, <A platform to support the product servitization, {eid: 84989873447}>, <The IDEAS project: Plug & produce at shop-floor level, {eid: 84859371668}>, <The adapter module: A building block for self-learning production systems, {eid: 84936890916}>, <None, {eid: 84926634169}>, <None, {eid: 84926615346}>, <Cyber-physical systems, {eid: 81055129165}>, <None, {eid: 84870773703}>, <None, {eid: 84944405978}>, <The design, deployment, and assessment of industrial agent systems, {eid: 84944415991}>, <IT support of mechatronic networks: A brief survey, {eid: 80052865338}>, <Agent-based distributed manufacturing control: A state-ofthe-art survey, {eid: 70149094122}>, <Software agents in industry: A customized framework in theory and praxis, {eid: 67349260153}>, <None, {eid: 84926679373}>, <None, {eid: 84869073557}>, <Serviceoriented computing: A research roadmap, {eid: 45149127474}>, <REST based OPC UA for the IIoT, {eid: 85057255800}>, <Structure of the administration shell.

It will enable companies to form a connected ""smart manufacturing"" ecosystem having interconnections between the suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and even the products in order to provide better services to the end customer. However, due to the presence of heterogeneous systems that might not adhere to the industrial standards, there is a gap in achieving this vision of an interconnected ecosystem. In this paper, we focus on providing a solution for the modularity and interoperability issues related to the Industry 4.0 from a systems integration viewpoint. We propose a model-based approach for modular complex systems development by separating (1) the behavior model and (2) the implementation logic (execution) of the system. Moreover, we use unified modeling language (UML) based modeling techniques to model system behavior and connect the behavior models to the application programming interface (API) of the CPS. Thus, instead of generating source code for the CPS using models, we directly execute the CPS in the physical world via model execution. The model execution is supported by the standard execution semantics of UML. Using our approach, multiple heterogeneous systems can be modeled and integrated together to create a ""plug and play"" ecosystem needed for achieving the vision of Industry 4.0.","CPS, Industry 4.1, Integration, Lego EV3 Robot., MDE, Model Execution, Model-driven Engineering, Modularity, Smart Factory, UML",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84889009713}>, <Conceiving the model-driven smart factory, {eid: 84958529967}>, <None, {eid: 85046623664}>, <None, {eid: 84908874427}>, <Modeling and reusing robotic software architectures: The hyperflex toolchain, {eid: 84929193296}>, <Executable modeling with fuml and alf in papyrus: Tooling and experiments, {eid: 84964491279}>, <Thingml: A language and code generation framework for heterogeneous targets, {eid: 85008457888}>, <Design principles for industrie 4.0 scenarios, {eid: 84975454820}>, <None, {eid: 84904867556}>, <Modeling automationml: Semantic web technologies vs. Model-driven engineering, {eid: 84952900461}>, <None, {eid: 85046679995}>, <None, {eid: 85046681421}>, <None, {eid: 85046659826}>, <None, {eid: 85046683033}>, <None, {eid: 85046654437}>, <An efficient modeling and execution framework for complex systems development, {eid: 79960535709}>, <None, {eid: 85046669035}>, <None, {eid: 84994044518}>, <Model-based development and simulation for robotic systems with sysml, simulink and simscape profiles, {eid: 84876943050}>, <None, {eid: 84921896242}>, <Modeldriven software systems engineering in robotics: Covering the complete life-cycle of a robot, {eid: 84996568815}>, <Modeldriven engineering and run-time model-usage in service robotics, {eid: 84867527894}>, <Towards a systematic, tool-independent methodology for defining the execution semantics of uml profiles with fuml, {eid: 84906901829}>, <None, {eid: 0003683075}>, <Using context-aware workflows for failure management in a smart factory, {eid: 84881559676}>",,,SciTePress,,,2017-02-19,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85044477572

The EHR is an evolving concept driven by ongoing developments and open or unclear legal issues concerning medical technologies, cross-domain data integration, and unclear access roles. Consequently, an interdisciplinary discourse based on representative pilot scenarios is required to connect previously unconnected domains. Objective: We address cross-domain data integration including access control using the specific example of a unique device identification (UDI)–expanded hip implant. In fact, the integration of technical focus data into the hospital information system (HIS) is considered based on surgically relevant information. Moreover, the acquisition of social focus data based on mobile health (mHealth) is addressed, covering data integration and networking with therapeutic intervention and acute diagnostics data. Methods: In addition to the additive manufacturing of a hip implant with the integration of a UDI, we built a database that combines database technology and a wrapper layer known from extract, transform, load systems and brings it into a SQL database, WEB application programming interface (API) layer (back end), interface layer (rest API), and front end. It also provides semantic integration through connection mechanisms between data elements. Results: A hip implant is approached by design, production, and verification while linking operation-relevant specifics like implant-bone fit by merging patient-specific image material (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or a biomodel) and the digital implant twin for well-founded selection pairing. This decision-facilitating linkage, which improves surgical planning, relates to patient-specific postoperative influencing factors during the healing phase. A unique product identification approach is presented, allowing a postoperative read-out with state-of-the-art hospital technology while enabling future access scenarios for patient and implant data. The latter was considered from the manufacturing perspective using the process manufacturing chain for a (patient-specific) implant to identify quality-relevant data for later access. In addition, sensor concepts were identified to use to monitor the patient-implant interaction during the healing phase using wearables, for example. A data aggregation and integration concept for heterogeneous data sources from the considered focus domains is also presented. Finally, a hierarchical data access concept is shown, protecting sensitive patient data from misuse using existing scenarios. Conclusions: Personalized medicine requires cross-domain linkage of data, which, in turn, require an appropriate data infrastructure and adequate hierarchical data access solutions in a shared and federated data space. The hip implant is used as an example for the usefulness of cross-domain data linkage since it bundles social, medical, and technical aspects of the implantation. It is necessary to open existing databases using interfaces for secure integration of data from end devices and to assure availability through suitable access models while guaranteeing long-term, independent data persistence. A suitable strategy requires the combination of technical solutions from the areas of identity and trust, federated data storage, cryptographic procedures, and software engineering as well as organizational changes.","cyber-physical production systems, data integration ecosystem, electronic health record, hierarchical data access, mHealth, shell embedded role model, unique device

These systems are considered high-assurance since errors during execution could result in injury, loss of life, environmental impact, and/or financial loss. In order to facilitate the development and verification of dynamically adaptive systems, we separate functional concerns from adaptive concerns. Specifically, we model a dynamically adaptive program as a collection of (non-adaptive) steady-state programs and a set of adaptations that realize transitions among steady state programs in response to environmental changes. We use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to specify properties of the non-adaptive portions of the system, and we use A-LTL (an adapt-operator extension to LTL) to concisely specify properties that hold during the adaptation process. Model checking offers an attractive approach to automatically analyzing models for adherence to formal properties and thus providing assurance. However, currently, model checkers are unable to verify properties specified using A-LTL. Moreover, as the number of steady-state programs and adaptations increase, the verification costs (in terms of space and time) potentially become unwieldy. To address these issues, we propose a modular model checking approach to verifying that a formal model of an adaptive program satisfies its requirements specified in LTL and A-LTL, respectively.

Despite the many advantages brought about by modern information and communications technologies, the shift from isolated environments to ""systems-of-systems"" integrated with massive information and communications infrastructures (e.g., the Internet) exposes critical infrastructures to significant cyber threats. Therefore, it is imperative to develop approaches for identifying and ranking assets in complex, large-scale and heterogeneous critical infrastructures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel methodology for assessing the impacts of cyber attacks on critical infrastructures. The methodology is inspired by research in system dynamics and sensitivity analysis. The proposed behavioral analysis methodology computes the covariances of the observed variables before and after the execution of a specific intervention involving the control variables. Metrics are proposed for quantifying the significance of control variables and measuring the impact propagation of cyber attacks.Experiments conducted on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 300-bus electric grid models, and on the well-known Tennessee Eastman chemical process demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and cross-sector applicability of the proposed methodology in several attack scenarios. The advantages of the methodology over graph-theoretic and electrical centrality metric approaches are demonstrated using several test cases. Finally, a novel, stealthy cyber-physical attack is demonstrated against a simulated power grid; this attack can be used to analyze the precision of anomaly detection systems.","Critical infrastructures, Cyber attacks, Impact assessment, Sensitivity analysis, Smart grid, System dynamics",,,,,,,,"<Performance of electric power systems under physical malicious attacks, {eid: 84885188346}>, <Electric grid facing security threats from all sides, {eid: 84939287432}>, <Attacks against process control systems: Risk assessment, detection and response, {eid: 79956009493}>, <Lessons from Stuxnet, {eid: 79953895474}>, <Using interconnected risk maps to assess the threats faced by electricity infrastructures, {eid: 84888069654}>, <Comparing the topological and electrical structure of the North American electric power infrastructure, {eid: 84870485080}>, <A plant-wide industrial process control problem, {eid: 0027561446}>, <A modeling framework for the resilience analysis of networked systems-of-systems based on functional dependencies, {eid: 84896312956}>, <A behavioral approach to feedback loop dominance analysis, {eid: 0346405507}>, <Counterintuitive behavior of social systems, {eid: 33644652390}>, <Introduction to industrial control networks, {eid: 84877580241}>, <Analysis of the effects of distributed denial-of-service attacks on MPLS networks, {eid: 84879787411}>, <Physical process resilience-aware network design for SCADA systems, {eid: 84894904843}>, <Phasor measurement unit selection for unobservable electric power data integrity attack detection, {eid: 84906948800}>, <Stuxnet and the vital role of critical infrastructure operators and engineers, {eid: 84918533075}>, <Do topological models provide good information about electricity infrastructure vulnerability?, {eid: 78649403784}>, <The Ford method: A sensitivity analysis approach, {eid: 85028836076}>, <None, {eid: 84939287434}>, <Vulnerabilities of cyber-physical systems to stale data - Determining the optimal time to launch attacks, {eid: 84918570655}>, <Towards a framework for cyber attack impact analysis of the electric smart grid, {eid: 82155164993}>, <How Dragonfly hackers and RAT malware threaten ICS security, {eid: 84939287435}>, <An open source power system analysis toolbox, {eid: 24944490963}>, <Impact of time delays on power system stability, {eid: 84859717042}>, <Decentralized control of the Tennessee Eastman challenge process, {eid: 0030217795}>, <Cyber attack impact on critical smart grid infrastructures, {eid: 84901951363}>, <Model-based attack detection and mitigation for automatic generation control, {eid: 84896872507}>, <Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security, {eid: 55549116194}>, <Dragonfly: Cyberespionage Attacks Against Energy Suppliers, {eid: 84928737655}>, <Electrical centrality measures for electric power grid vulnerability analysis, {eid: 79953159469}>, <Generating statistically correct random topologies for testing smart grid communications and control networks, {eid: 77952887424}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2015-09-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-84939255911

A promising direction in this context is the concept of Zero-Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) aiming at further automatization and optimisation of the production processes to reduce resources and avoid useless elements in the production chains. Moreover, the modern industrial systems are highly complex and require collaboration with other systems for the products’ manufacturing and maintenance. This fact leads to the necessity for the better approaches for design, development, evaluation and assessment of manufacturing systems. The goal of this article is to assess some key European research projects on industrial manufacturing to re-use their achievements for design of the ZDM systems. Another goal is to identify the basis for an umbrella platform able to integrate the functionalities of other manufacturing platforms.

Therefore, it is important for the firmware of these devices to be tested sufficiently. On non-constrained conventional devices, dynamic testing techniques (e.g. fuzzing, symbolic execution, or concolic testing) are successfully utilized to discover critical bugs in tested software. Unfortunately, the diverse ecosystem and the dependence on low-level details of a wide range of peripherals makes it difficult to use these techniques in the IoT context. In order to address these challenges, we present SymEx-VP an open source emulation-based approach for concolic testing of IoT firmware. SymEx-VP is a virtual prototype for RISC-V hardware platforms and allows concolic testing of RISC-V machine code. To support a wide range of different peripherals, SymEx-VP utilizes SystemC, a hardware modeling language for C++. By employing a SystemC extension mechanism, SymEx-VP can inject concolic inputs into the emulated firmware through the memory-mapped I/O peripheral interface of existing SystemC peripheral models. This allows us to support different operating systems and libraries used in the IoT with minimal integration effort. We provide an extensive description of SymEx-VP, illustrate peripheral modeling and firmware testing using it by example, and perform tests with four operating systems to demonstrate the advantages of our OS-agnostic firmware testing method.","Concolic testing, Internet of things, RISC-V, SystemC, Virtual prototyping",,,,,,,,"<Security and privacy challenges in industrial internet of things, {eid:

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Over the last decades, different kinds of design guides have been created to maintain consistency and usability in interactive system development. However, in the case of spatial applications, practitioners from research and industry either have difficulty finding them or perceive such guides as lacking relevance, practicability, and applicability. This paper presents the current state of scientific research and industry practice by investigating currently used design recommendations for mixed reality (MR) system development. We analyzed and compared 875 design recommendations for MR applications elicited from 89 scientific papers and documentation from six industry practitioners in a literature review. In doing so, we identified differences regarding four key topics: Focus on unique MR design challenges, abstraction regarding devices and ecosystems, level of detail and abstraction of content, and covered topics. Based on that, we contribute to the MR design research by providing three factors for perceived irrelevance and six main implications for design recommendations that are applicable in scientific and industry practice.","Augmented Reality, Design Recommendations, Design Theory and Practice, Guidelines, Mixed Reality, User Interface Design",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84908027661}>, <Design concept and

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Nowadays, the concept of “Everything is connected to Everything” has spread to reach increasingly diverse scenarios, due to the benefits of constantly being able to know, in real-time, the status of your factory, your city, your health or your smallholding. This wide variety of scenarios creates different challenges such as the heterogeneity of IoT devices, support for large numbers of connected devices, reliable and safe systems, energy efficiency and the possibility of using this system by third-parties in other scenarios. A transversal middleware in all IoT solutions is called an IoT platform. the IoT platform is a piece of software that works like a kind of “glue” to combine platforms and orchestrate capabilities that connect devices, users and applications/services in a “cyber-physical” world. In this way, the IoT platform can help solve the challenges listed above. This paper proposes an IoT agnostic architecture, highlighting the role of the IoT platform, within a broader ecosystem of interconnected tools, aiming at increasing scalability, stability, interoperability and reusability. For that purpose, different paradigms of computing will be used, such as microservices architecture and serverless computing. Additionally, a technological proposal of the architecture, called SEnviro Connect, is presented. This proposal is validated in the IoT scenario of smart farming, where five IoT devices (SEnviro nodes) have been deployed to improve wine production. A comprehensive performance evaluation is carried out to guarantee a scalable and stable platform.","Internet of things, Iot platform, Microservices, Serverless, Smart farming, Vineyar

In order to achieve its intended functionalities, IoV requires anytime anywhere connectivity, which cannot be satisfied by traditional networking technologies. Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN) is widely believed to be an ideal infrastructure for connecting IoV. In this article, we present an approach for understanding the security issues of complex IoT systems, and propose a security reference architecture for assessing security risks and addressing the security requirements. Specifically, we propose an activity-network-things (ANT)-centric security reference architecture, which is based on the three architectural perspectives in studying IoT systems, namely, device, Internet, and semantic. We discuss the limitations of existing IoT system architecture models, which are mainly evolved from the enterprise system architecture with some adaptation to the inherent features of IoT systems. Our approach can help manage the security risks by focusing on the critical activities performed in different microperimeters within an IoT system. The proposed architecture includes an organized process to understand the security requirements and select specific parameters for tailored security controls that are commensurate with organization-specific and application-specific security impacts of IoT. Our architecture is flexible enough to cater for any IoT application, and hence, can be easily applied to the case of SAGIN-enabled IoV.","Cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Vehicles

The ability to fully exploit computational architectures’ heterogeneity and concurrency will be a key point. In this manuscript we present the BondMachine (BM), an innovative prototype software ecosystem aimed at creating facilities where hardware and software are co-designed, guaranteeing a full exploitation of fabric capabilities (both in terms of concurrency and heterogeneity) with several hardware optimization possibilities. The fundamental innovation of the BM is to provide a new kind of computer architecture, where the hardware dynamically adapts to the specific computational problem rather than being static and generic, as in standard CPUs synthesized in silicon. Hardware can be designed to fit precisely any computational task needs, implementing only the processing units needed and discarding generic solutions. By using BMs within FPGA technologies end-to-end solutions could be realized, in which the creation of domain-specific hardware is part of the development process as much as the software stack. FPGA technology allows to create independent processing units on a single low-power board, and to design their interconnections “in silicon” to maximally fit the design needs. The processors of the BMs are suitable for computational structures like neural networks and tensor processing models. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) popularity keeps increasing in scientific and industrial areas.","BondMachine, Domain specific architectures, Hardware/software co-design, Reconfigurable computing",,,,,,,,"<Moores law: past, present and future, {eid: 0031166167}>, <The TOP500: History, Trends, and Future Directions in High Performance Computing, {eid: 84962396167}>, <International technology roadmap for semiconductors systems drivers, {eid: 65549093343}>, <A chip-multiprocessor architecture with speculative multithreading, {eid: 0033348795}>, <Low-overhead fault-tolerance technique for a dynamically reconfigurable softcore processor, {eid: 84877275452}>, <An FPGA-based reconfigurable mesh many-core, {eid: 84910066294}>, <A dynamically reconfigurable system for closed-loop measurements of network traffic, {eid: 84892429936}>, <R3TOS: A novel reliable reconfigurable real-time operating system for highly adaptive, efficient, and dependable computing on FPGAs, {eid: 84880157884}>, <ReconOS: An operating system approach for reconfigurable computing, {eid: 84897131535}>, <Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects, {eid: 84937801713}>, <A modern primer on processing in memory, {eid: 85101949694}>, <A survey of different approaches for overcoming the processor-memory bottleneck, {eid: 85072349421}>, <Internet of things: Vision, applications and research challenges, {eid: 84861997111}>, <Modeling cyber physical systems, {eid: 84155172767}>, <Energy efficient computing, clusters, grids and clouds: A taxonomy and survey, {eid: 85015935769}>, <The transprecision computing paradigm: Concept, design, and applications, {eid: 85048746456}>, <Toward a modular precision ecosystem for high-performance computing, {eid: 85065722654}>, <The Rocket Chip Generator: Tech.

There is a significant volume of research by the software architecture community that aims to overcome the challenges involved in architecting SoS, as evidenced by the number of secondary studies in the field published so far. However, the boundaries of such research do not seem to be well defined, at least partially, due to the emergence of SoS-adjacent areas of interest like the Internet of Things.Objective: This paper aims to investigate the current state of research on SoS architecting by synthesizing the demographic data, assessing the quality and the coverage of architecting activities and software quality attributes by the research, and distilling a concept map that reflects a community-wide understanding of the concept of SoS. Method: We conduct what is, to the best of our understanding, the first tertiary study on SoS architecting. Such tertiary study was based on five research questions, and was performed by following the guidelines of Kitchenham et al. In all, 19 secondary studies were evaluated, which is comparable to other tertiary studies. Results: The study illustrates a state of disconnection in the research community, with research gaps in the coverage of particular phases and quality attributes. Furthermore, a more effective approach in classifying systems as SoS is required, as the means of resolving conceptual and terminological overlaps with the related domains. Conclusions: Despite the amount of research in the area of SoS architecting, more coordinated and systematic targeted efforts are required in order to address the identified issues with the current state of research.","SoS Architecting, Systematic literature review, Systems of Systems, Tertiary study",,,,,,,,"<Architecting principles for systems-of-systems, {eid: 85045953475}>, <Emergent

Published by Elsevier Ltd.The change in products is taking place rapidly, from primarily electromechanical components to cyber physical systems. The associated digitalization in development, production and use is primarily based on data. In order to increase the potentials, a high quality, timeliness and availability of the data is necessary. Due to the increasing number of IT-based systems, interoperability between them is becoming more important. Without the appropriate interfaces and the openness of the systems, additional effort is required. If an appropriate PLM strategy is in current discussion, the principles of ""agile strategy development"" show high potential. With the further development of the Code of PLM Openness into a certification approach, it is possible to generate a base for an agile product life cycle management. In order to ensure the openness of systems, the developing company must also be in focus.","Agile PLM strategy, Certification, Openness",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85082755432}>, <None, {eid: 85082777405}>, <None, {eid: 85082737052}>, <Bewertung der Offenheit von Engineering-Tools, open automation, {eid: 85082738276}>, <Vom Suchen und Warten zu agilen Entwicklungsprozessen - Product Lifecycle Management im Kontext von Industrie 4.0, {eid: 85082751734}>, <Was die Produkt- Von der Softwareentwicklung lernen kann - Durchgängige Integration disziplinspezifischer Modelle durch den Einsatz von Modellierungssprachen, {eid: 85059937551}>, <Agile PLM strategy development - Methods and success factors, {eid: 85060349798}>, <Openness and requirements: Opportunities and tradeoffs in software ecosystems, {eid: 84909952753}>, <None, {eid: 85048837023}>, <Neuer Boom Für PLM“, Interview with Karsten Theis, d1g1tale Agenda 1/2017, {eid: 85082743837}>, <None, {eid: 85082774092}>, <None, {eid: 85082774766}>, <None, {eid: 85082754437}>, <None, {eid: 85082740336}>, <None, {eid: 85082778879}>, <None, {eid: 85082740253}>, <A model for diagnosing organizational behavior, {eid: 0002966633}>, <CPO - On the way from commitment to certification, {eid: 85082742546}>, <None, {eid: 85082773769}>, <None, {eid: 85082758934}>, <None, {eid: 85082775741}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2019-08-09,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85082763774

However, the alignment of these elements has rarely been the central focus of these studies. As a result, important questions regarding the alignment of MBE and development processes, as well as the impact of development processes on the utilization and success of MBE, have remained unanswered. To address this research gap, we conducted a multiple-case study involving 14 individuals from nine different companies, conducting a total of 12 interviews. Building upon seven propositions derived from existing literature, our investigation sought to understand how MBE is aligned with the development process and explore the application of MBE in this context. Additionally, we identified challenges and needs in this area. Our findings challenge some previously reported results, such as the perceived conflicts between agile development processes and MBE. Furthermore, we unearthed previously unreported issues, like the importance of considering the perspectives of tool vendors in MBE discussions. Overall, this paper makes a significant contribution by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date perspective on how MBE is integrated into development processes, along with an examination of the social and organizational aspects inherent to these processes.

On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) is currently in very strong emergence and people's interest in it is increasingly growing. Surprisingly, interaction between IoT and PLM systems are very scarce to this day. Industrialists have enabled a few connections when and where return on investment was high and certain. However, nowadays, the struggle for systems integration remains as the culture difference between PLM's engineering background and IoT's computer science background remains. This research work aims to bridge the gap by making explicit all previous research on PLM and IoT through a systematic literature review that explicits IoT's evolving perimeter over the latest decade. It also tackles literature's approach between the PLM & IoT information systems and humans. It finally proposes and discusses a framework supporting the integration of PLM and IoT in manufacturing industry.","Cyber-physical system, Digital thread, Enterprise information system, Internet of

The evolution of IT systems has currently arrived at a level that involves complex systems integration and business ecosystems in which many stakeholders in different roles are involved. A new paradigm for digital innovation is needed that copes with this increased complexity. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an empirically informed framework for analysing and designing viable, sustainable digital innovation ecosystems in the agri-food domain. METHODS: The research is based on a series of European large-scale public-private innovation projects from 2011 to 2021 with a total budget of 73 M€. They involved hundreds of stakeholders that were developing a large number of digital solutions through which a digital innovation ecosystem for agri-food was formed. In a longitudinal study, a conceptual framework was used to analyse these projects and describe how the digital innovation ecosystem has developed. Lessons learnt are translated into a number of design principles and an organizational approach to foster digital innovation ecosystems in agri-food. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual framework consists of 6 key concepts: (i) innovation strategy, (ii) innovation organization, (iii) innovation network that contains (iv) the innovation process and (v) the innovation object and finally (vi) an innovation infrastructure. Along these 6 concepts, lessons learnt and in total 21 design principles are derived from analysing the projects forming a basis for the organizational framework. At the core of this framework is a lean multi-actor approach to trials and use case development interacting with a set of multidisciplinary activities: (i) developing a common technical collaboration infrastructure, (ii) identifying value streams with user engagement, (iii) engaging the right partners and stakeholders at the right time supported by strategic project planning and dynamic management. The most important conclusion is that effective, successful and quick use of appropriate IT in agri-food requires that actors should not be analysed in isolation from both their technological and business environment. Another consequence is that a ‘minimal viable ecosystem’ only emerges after considerable time, resources and ingenuity is invested and may require outside (government) intervention.

(AUID: 56888222100),,"Thermodynamics and its prediction and CALPHAD modeling: Review, state of the art, and perspectives",2023,Calphad: Computer Coupling of Phase Diagrams and Thermochemistry,,,,,,,16.0,10.1016/j.calphad.2023.102580,https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.calphad.2023.102580,"<Department of Materials Science and Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University>",,"© 2023 Elsevier LtdThermodynamics is a science concerning the state of a system, whether it is stable, metastable, or unstable, when interacting with its surroundings. The combined law of thermodynamics derived by Gibbs about 150 years ago laid the foundation of thermodynamics. In Gibbs combined law, the entropy production due to internal processes was not included, and the 2nd law was thus practically removed from the Gibbs combined law, so it is only applicable to systems under equilibrium, thus commonly termed as equilibrium or Gibbs thermodynamics. Gibbs further derived the classical statistical thermodynamics in terms of the probability of configurations in a system in the later 1800's and early 1900's. With the quantum mechanics (QM) developed in 1920's, the QM-based statistical thermodynamics was established and connected to classical statistical thermodynamics at the classical limit as shown by Landau in the 1940's. In 1960's the development of density functional theory (DFT) by Kohn and co-workers enabled the QM prediction of properties of the ground state of a system. On the other hand, the entropy production due to internal processes in non-equilibrium systems was studied separately by Onsager in 1930's and Prigogine and co-workers in the 1950's. In 1960's to 1970's the digitization of thermodynamics was developed by Kaufman in the framework of the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) modeling of individual phases with internal degrees of freedom. CALPHAD modeling of thermodynamics and atomic transport properties has enabled computational design of complex materials in the last 50 years. Our recently termed zentropy theory integrates DFT and statistical mechanics through the replacement of the internal energy of each individual configuration by its DFT-predicted free energy. The zentropy theory is capable of accurately predicting the free energy of individual phases, transition temperatures and properties of magnetic and ferroelectric materials with free energies of individual configurations solely from DFT-based calculations and without fitting parameters, and is being tested for other phenomena including superconductivity, quantum criticality, and black holes. Those predictions include the singularity at critical points with divergence of physical properties, negative thermal expansion, and the strongly correlated physics. Those individual configurations may thus be considered as the genomic building blocks of individual phases in the spirit of the materials genome®. This has the potential to shift the paradigm of CALPHAD modeling from being heavily dependent on experimental inputs to becoming fully predictive with inputs solely from DFT-based calculations and machine learning models built on those calculations and existing experimental data through newly developed and future open-source tools. Furthermore, through the combined law of thermodynamics including the internal entropy production, it is shown that the kinetic coefficient matrix of independent internal processes is diagonal with respect to the conjugate potentials in the combined law, and the cross phenomena that the phenomenological Onsager flux and reciprocal relationships are due to the dependence of the conjugate potential of a molar quantity on nonconjugate molar quantities and other potentials, which can be predicted by the zentropy theory and CALPHAD modeling.",,,,,,,,,"<Predicted advances in the design of new materials, {eid: 85146374465}>, <Materials 4.0 and the materials genome initiative, {eid: 85108336371}>, <Quantisierung als, {eid: 84975485648}>, <An undulatory theory of the mechanics of atoms and molecules, {eid: 0001500684}>, <Inhomogeneous electron gas, {eid: 10644250257}>, <Self-consistent equations including exchange and correlation effects.

The resulting misunderstandings often seriously compromise the missions the system is supporting (over 80% of the functionality in most current ground, sea, air, and space vehicles depends on software). There is a major need for models, methods, processes, and tools for identifying sources and effects of software misunderstandings, both in preparation for the system's software use and evolution, and in evaluating modified software to avoid further examples of misunderstanding. Emphasizing high software understandability enables system maintainers to avoid these misunderstandings as they modify existing software systems. However, while many metrics for understandability have been developed, with the majority of them being source code based, little to no correlation has been found for these metrics with actual software understandability. In this paper, we instead focus on issue summaries as a non-source code alternative for measuring understandability. We generate fuzzy rules and linguistic patterns using a sample of issue summaries from the Mozilla community and evaluate 1416 issue summaries from two other software systems to measure the performance of our model. Our results suggest that this is a viable method to measure understandability and has the potential to be extended to other software maintainability qualities.","empirical study, natural language processing, software understandability",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0003895570}>, <None, {eid: 0003877540}>, <Fuzzy methods in machine learning and data mining: Status and prospects, {eid: 26944491093}>, <Fuzzy control, {eid: 85009964264}>, <Automatically assessing code understandability: How far are we?, {eid: 85041431985}>, <How Do Defects Hurt Qualities?

Therefore, data management approaches for smart environments need to support flexibility, dynamicity, incremental change, while keeping costs to a minimum. A Dataspace is an emerging approach to data management that has proved fruitful for personal information and scientific data management. However, their use within smart environments and for real-time data remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as an enabling platform for data management within smart environments. This paper identifies common data management requirements for smart energy and water environments, details the RLD architecture and the key support services and their tiered support levels, and a principled approach to “Pay-As-You-Go” data management. The paper presents a dataspace query service for real-time data streams and entities to enable unified entity-centric queries across live and historical stream data. The RLD was validated in 5 real-world pilot smart environments following the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop to build real-time analytics, decisions support, and smart apps for energy and water management. The pilots demonstrate that the RLD enables incremental pay-as-you-go data management with support services that simplify the development of applications and analytics for smart environments. Finally, the paper discusses experiences, lessons learnt, and future directions.","Data management, Dataspace, Distributed systems, Energy management, Event processing, Internet of Things, Linked data, Semantic web, Smart environments, Water management",,,,,,,,"<Internet-of-things-based smart environments: State of the art, taxonomy, and open research challenges, {eid: 85012142799}>, <New Horizons for a Data-Driven Economy: A Roadmap for Usage and Exploitation of Big Data in Europe, {eid: 85030159377}>, <Middleware: A model for distributed system service, {eid: 0030083693}>, <The challenges of mobile computing, {eid: 0028422189}>, <Smart cities –enabling services and applications, {eid: 84976466169}>, <A context-based infrastructure for smart environments, {eid: 0002263079}>, <Beyond Weiser: From ubiquitous to collective computing, {eid: 84962129758}>, <The origins of ubiquitous computing research at PARC in the late 1980s, {eid: 0033362595}>, <Building a big data platform for smart cities: Experience and lessons from Santander, {eid: 84959495037}>, <Building software for the internet of things, {eid: 84925875665}>, <The internet of things: A survey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <The internet of things: A survey from the data-centric perspective, {eid: 84929570622}>, <Linking building data in the cloud: Integrating cross-domain building data using linked data, {eid: 84876676897}>, <Enterprise energy management using a linked dataspace for energy intelligence, {eid: 84872388884}>, <Linked water data for water information management, {eid: 84941064856}>, <SPITFIRE: Toward a semantic web of things, {eid: 81355138520}>, <CityPulse: Large scale data analytics framework for smart cities, {eid: 84978630397}>, <OpenIoT: Open source internet-of-things in the cloud, {eid: 84930428706}>, <Enabling a smart city application ecosystem: Requirements and architectural aspects, {eid: 84963838165}>, <Physical-cyber-social computing: An early 21st-century approach, {eid: 84874591962}>, <None, {eid: 80054792068}>, <None, {eid: 85051931620}>, <Big Data: Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Realtime Data Systems, {eid: 84877040956}>, <ThingStore: A platform for internet-of-things application development and deployment, {eid: 84960970283}>, <From databases to dataspaces: A new abstraction for information management, {eid: 31444453796}>, <iDM : A unified and versatile data model for personal dataspace management, {eid: 84893874495}>, <A dataspace odyssey: The iMeMex personal dataspace management system, {eid: 84858640269}>, <A dataspace infrastructure for astronomical data, {eid: 0346270589}>, <Linked biomedical dataspace: Lessons learned integrating data for drug discovery, {eid: 84908676103}>, <A Framework for Fine-grained Data Integration and Curation, with Provenance, in a Dataspace, {eid: 85051939088}>, <Supporting context-based query in personal dataspace, {eid: 74549180488}>, <Modeling heterogeneous data in dataspace, {eid: 51949107423}>, <Data modeling in dataspace support platforms, {eid: 69049087883}>, <DataSpace: A data web for the exploratory analysis and mining of data, {eid: 0036645565}>, <None, {eid: 85051941489}>, <Pay-as-you-go user feedback for dataspace systems, {eid: 57149131807}>, <System of systems information interoperability using a linked dataspace, {eid: 84872420666}>, <Querying heterogeneous datasets on the linked data web: challenges, approaches, and trends, {eid: 84855690015}>, <Natural language queries over heterogeneous linked data graphs: A distributional-compositional semantics approach, {eid: 84897808847}>, <Linked data: Evolving the web into a global data space, {eid: 85046448768}>, <Thematic event processing, {eid: 84920418518}>, <Curry, Thingsonomy: Tackling variety in internet of things events, {eid: 84925841316}>, <Toward situation awareness for the semantic sensor web: Complex event processing with dynamic linked data enrichment, {eid: 84881192586}>, <None, {eid: 84893619613}>, <ACRyLIQ: Leveraging DBpedia for adaptive crowdsourcing in linked data quality assessment, {eid: 84997113385}>, <Efficient task assignment for spatial crowdsourcing: A combinatorial fractional optimization approach with semi-bandit learning, {eid: 84963620273}>, <None, {eid: 85052003585}>, <None, {eid: 85051982036}>, <Response time in man-computer conversational transactions, {eid: 0014380830}>, <Usability Engineering, vol. 2, {eid: 85051984170}>, <Next-generation smart environments: From system of systems to data ecosystems, {eid: 85051144366}>, <Towards a generalized approach for deep neural network based event processing for the internet of multimedia things, {eid: 85045218142}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2019-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85051954847

With thousands of packages available per stable distribution, encapsulating algorithms, sensor drivers, etc., it is the de facto middleware for robotics. Like any software ecosystem, ROS must evolve in order to keep meeting the requirements of its users. In practice, packages may end up being abandoned between releases: no one may be available to update a package, or newer packages offer similar functionality. As such, we wanted to identify and understand the evolution challenges faced by the ROS ecosystem. In this article, we report our findings after interviewing 19 ROS developers in depth, followed by a focus group (4 participants) and an online survey of 119 ROS community members. We specifically focused on the issues surrounding package reuse and how to contribute to existing packages. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our findings, and propose five recommendations for overcoming the identified issues, with the goal of improving the health of the ROS ecosystem.","Package management, Robot Operating System, Software ecosystems",,,,,,,,"<Monetary rewards for open source software developers, {eid: 85061817638}>, <How to break an API: cost negotiation and community values in three software ecosystems, {eid: 84997523703, doi: 10.1145/2950290.2950325}>, <Present and future robot control development–an industrial perspective, {eid: 34249306573, doi: 10.1016/j.arcontrol.2007.01.002}>, <Open robot control software: the OROCOS project, {eid: 0034860991, doi: 10.1109/ROBOT.2001.933002}>, <An empirical study of end-user programmers in the computer music community, {eid: 84957096688}>, <Why modern open source projects fail, {eid: 85030781379}>, <Identifying unmaintained projects in GitHub, {eid: 85061514500}>, <An empirical comparison of developer retention in the RubyGems and npm software ecosystems, {eid: 85027837421, doi: 10.1007/s11334-017-0303-4}>, <Evaluating impact in the ROS ecosystem, {eid: 84938230043, doi: 10.1109/ICRA.2015.7140071}>, <How to gamify software engineering, {eid: 85018443363}>, <When GitHub meets CRAN: an analysis of inter-repository package dependency problems, {eid: 84997434682, doi: 10.1109/SANER.2016.12}>, <How ROS cares for quality, {eid: 85061829666}>, <Understanding gamification mechanisms for software development, {eid: 84883706177, doi: 10.1145/2491411.2494589}>, <Code duplication in ROS launchfiles, {eid: 85061775991}>, <Towards long-lived robot genes, {eid: 41749120800}>, <ROS Community Metrics Report, {eid: 85061818704}>, <What recommendation systems for software engineering recommend: a systematic literature review, {eid: 84962376126}>, <The evolution of the R software ecosystem, {eid: 84877268644, doi: 10.1109/CSMR.2013.33}>, <Robotic assistance in coordination of patient care, {eid: 85045832593, doi: 10.15607/rss.2016.xii.026}>, <The impact of ideology on effectiveness in open source software development teams, {eid: 33745021689, doi: 10.2307/25148732}>, <Encouraging user behaviour with achievements: an empirical study, {eid: 84883615731}>, <Effective robot teammate behaviors for supporting sequential manipulation tasks, {eid: 84958177143, doi: 10.1109/IROS.2015.7354288}>, <Do code smells hamper novice programming?

The resulting diverse communication requirements will demand networking with unprecedented flexibility, not currently provided by the monolithic black-box approach of 4G cellular networks. The research community and an increasing number of standardization bodies and industry coalitions have recognized softwarization, virtualization, and disaggregation of networking functionalities as the key enablers of the needed shift to flexibility. Particularly, software-defined cellular networks are heralded as the prime technology to satisfy the new application-driven traffic requirements and to support the highly time-varying topology and interference dynamics, because of their openness through well-defined interfaces, and programmability, for swift and responsive network optimization. Leading the technological innovation in this direction, several 5G software-based projects and alliances have embraced the open source approach, making new libraries and frameworks available to the wireless community. This race to open source softwarization, however, has led to a deluge of solutions whose interoperability and interactions are often unclear. This article provides the first cohesive and exhaustive compendium of recent open source software and frameworks for 5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective. We detail their capabilities and functionalities focusing on how their constituting elements fit the 5G ecosystem, and unravel the interactions among the surveyed solutions. Finally, we review hardware and testbeds on which these frameworks can run, and provide a critical perspective on the limitations of the state-of-the-art, as well as feasible directions toward fully open source, programmable 5G networks.","5G, Network Function Virtualization, O-RAN, ONAP, Open Source, Software-defined Networking",,,,,,,,"<NR: The new 5G radio access technology, {eid:

Parallel programming languages are nowadays paramount to extracting the tremendous potential offered by these platforms: parallel computing is no longer a niche in the high performance computing (HPC) field, but an essential ingredient in all domains of computer science. The advent of next-generation many-core embedded platforms has the chance of intercepting a converging need for predictable high-performance coming from both the High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Embedded Computing (EC) domains. On one side, new kinds of HPC applications are being required by markets needing huge amounts of information to be processed within a bounded amount of time. On the other side, EC systems are increasingly concerned with providing higher performance in real-time, challenging the performance capabilities of current architectures. This converging demand raises the problem about how to guarantee timing requirements in presence of parallel execution. The paper presents how the time-criticality and parallelisation challenges are addressed by merging techniques coming from both HPC and EC domains, and provides an overview of the proposed framework to achieve these objectives.","Embedded systems, Many-core systems, Parallel programming models, Real-time scheduling, Real-time systems, WCET analysis",,,,,,,,"<Execution time analysis for embedded real-time systems, {eid: 77957952267}>, <None, {eid: 84949906612}>, <None, {eid: 84949808508}>, <A real-time scheduling service for parallel tasks, {eid: 84881097591}>, <Starpu: A unified platform for task scheduling on heterogeneous multicore architectures, {eid: 78651103346}>, <A generalized parallel task model for recurrent real-time processes, {eid: 84874295466}>, <Open problems in real-time scheduling, {eid: 78649860393}>, <P2012: Building an ecosystem for a scalable, modular and high-efficiency embedded computing accelerator, {eid: 84862104198}>, <Evolution of thread-level parallelism in desktop applications, {eid: 77954993217}>, <Scheduling multithreaded computations by work stealing, {eid: 0000269759}>, <A dynamic scheduler for balancing HPC applications, {eid: 70350787091}>, <Productive cluster programming with ompss, {eid: 80052384784}>, <None, {eid: 84887633587}>, <Response time analysis of cots-based multicores considering the contention on the shared memory bus, {eid: 84862958680}>, <Time-critical computing on a single-chip massively parallel processor, {eid: 84903845958}>, <On a real-time scheduling problem, {eid: 0017925569}>, <Ompss: A proposal for programming heterogeneous multi-core architectures, {eid: 79959734507}>, <Merasa: Multi-core execution of hard real-time applications supporting analysability, IEEE Micro 2010, {eid: 78649521961}>, <None, {eid: 84949906613}>, <None, {eid: 84951805085}>, <Architecture for a portable open source real-time kernal environment, {eid: 0007732949}>, <Towards an open source framework for small engine controls development, {eid: 84949906614}>, <Towards transparent parallel/distributed support for real-time embedded applications, {eid: 84885417898}>, <A portable runtime interface for multi-level memory hierarchies, {eid: 56849108794}>, <None, {eid: 84874081273}>, <None, {eid: 35448932427}>, <None, {eid: 84908117570}>, <None, {eid: 84949906616}>, <None, {eid: 84949906617}>, <Scheduling parallel real-time tasks on multi-core processors, {eid: 79951794986}>, <Scheduling parallel real-time tasks on multi-core processors, {eid: 79951794986}>, <When prefetching works, when it doesnt, and why, {eid: 84859463353}>, <None, {eid: 0038437454}>, <Timing anomalies in dynamically scheduled microprocessors, {eid: 0033337990}>, <Scheduling parallel real-time tasks using a fixed-priority work-stealing algorithm on multiprocessors, {eid: 84885400439}>, <Limited pre-emptive global fixed task priority, {eid: 84894344729}>, <Preemption delay analysis for floating non-preemptive region scheduling, {eid: 84862088263}>, <Extending fixed task-priority schedulability by interference limitation, {eid: 84870950830}>, <None, {eid: 84949791600}>, <None, {eid: 84949782953}>, <None, {eid: 0003500941}>, <Dynamic global scheduling of parallel real-time tasks, {eid: 84874053972}>, <On the use of work-stealing strategies in real-time systems, {eid: 84949906620}>, <None, {eid: 67650694407}>, <Openmp task scheduling strategies for multicore numa systems, {eid: 84861794609}>, <None, {eid: 84894846019}>, <None, {eid: 84863918549}>, <None, {eid: 84863918549}>, <None, {eid: 84905734398}>, <A predictable execution model for cots-based embedded systems, {eid: 79957583292}>, <Cellss: Making it easier to program the cell broadband engine processor, {eid: 35649006026}>, <None, {eid: 84949906621}>, <Multi-core real-time scheduling for generalized parallel task models, {eid: 84856518472}>, <Larrabee: A many-core x86 architecture for visual computing, {eid: 49249086142}>, <None, {eid: 84866878548}>, <None, {eid: 84949906622}>, <None, {eid: 84949769796}>, <None, {eid: 84949906623}>, <Tile Processor, {eid: 84949906624}>, <OpenMP and timing predictability: A possible union?, {eid: 84945925981}>, <Openacc: First experiences with real-world applications, {eid: 84867656693}>, <Pangaea: A tightly-coupled ia32 heterogeneous chip multiprocessor, {eid: 63549137920}>",,,Elsevier,,,2015-11-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-84949785179

Boosted by initiatives such as Industrie 4.0 in Germany or the Industrial Internet Consortium in the US, they are enablers for innovation in industrial automation. To provide the advanced flexibility in production envisioned for future automation systems, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), as one of their main building blocks, also need to become more flexible. However, the conservative nature of this domain prohibits changes in the controller architecture impacting the installed base. Currently there exist various approaches that evolve control architectures to the next level, but none of them address flexible function deployment at the same time with legacy support. In this paper, we present an architecture for a multi-purpose controller that is inspired by the virtualization trend in cloud systems which moves from heavyweight virtual machines to lightweight containers solutions such as LXC or Docker. Our solution includes the support for multiple PLC execution engines and adds support for the emulation of legacy engines as well. We evaluate this architecture by executing performance measurements that analyze the impact of container technologies to the real-time aspects of PLC engines.",,,,,,,,,"<Virtualize for architecture sustainability in industrial automation, {eid: 84900361089}>, <FASA: a software architecture and runtime framework for flexible distributed automation systems, {eid: 84923353571}>, <None, {eid: 85043519843}>, <None, {eid: 85043491144}>, <Challenges for software engineering in automation, {eid: 84910121678}>, <None, {eid: 85043528974}>, <Containers and cloud: from LXC to docker to Kubernetes, {eid: 84923248887}>, <OPC Unified Architecture, {eid: 84892029522}>, <Industrial automation as a cloud service, {eid: 84961827521}>, <Control-as-a-service from the cloud: acase study for using virtualized PLCs, {eid: 84903975775}>, <Cloud-based control: a multi-tenant, horizontally scalable soft-PLC, {eid: 84960192271}>, <Virtualization technologies in embedded real-time systems, {eid: 84890693195}>, <Virtualize for test environment in industrial automation, {eid: 84946693302}>, <The role of virtualization in embedded systems, {eid: 63149084013}>, <Migrating legacy control software to multi-core hardware, {eid: 84961629206}>, <A modular benchmark for evaluating load distribution algorithms, {eid: 85010031179, doi: 10.1109/IECON.2016.7793058}>, <Dynamic reconfiguration of distributed control applications with reconfiguration services based on IEC 61499, {eid: 33845460227, doi: 10.1109/DIS.2006.28}>, <Extension of reconfigurability provisions in IEC61499, {eid: 84890631186, doi: 10.1109/ETFA.2013.6648026}>, <Enhanced IEC 61499 device management execution and usage for downtimeless reconfiguration, {eid: 39749124922, doi: 10.1109/INDIN.2007.4384940}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2018-03-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85043529901

A new regime of exciting new “applications” that span a distributed fabric of sensors, actuators and humans has emerged to improve building energy efficiency and operations management. These applications leverage the technological advances in embedded sensing, processing, networking and methods by which they can be coupled with supervisory control and data acquisition systems deployed in modern buildings and with users on mobile wireless platforms. There are, however, several technical challenges to confront before such a vision of smart building applications and cyber-physical systems can be realized. The sensory data produced by these systems need significant curation before it can be used meaningfully. This is largely a manual, cost-prohibitive task and hence such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema. Recent attempts have sought to address this through data standards and metadata schemata but fall short in capturing the richness of relationships required by applications. This paper describes Brick, a uniform metadata schema for representing buildings that builds upon recent advances in the area. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and the relationships between them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight unmodified energy efficiency applications on these buildings.","Building management, Metadata, Ontology, Schema, Smart buildings",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85050114974}>,

Boundaries between devices blur with PC-tablet hybrids on the one side and wearables on the other. Future apps need to support a host of app-enabled devices with differing capabilities, along with their software ecosystems. Prior work on cross-platform app development concerned concepts and prototypes, and compared approaches that target smartphones. To aid choosing an appropriate framework and to support the scientific assessment of approaches, an up-to-date comparison framework is needed. Extending work on a holistic, weighted set of assessment criteria, we propose what could become the definitive framework for evaluating cross-platform approaches. We have based it on sound abstract concepts that allow extensions. The weighting capabilities offer customisation to avoid the proverbial comparison of apples and oranges lurking in the variety of available frameworks. Moreover, it advises on multiple development situations based on a single assessment. In this article, we motivate and describe our evaluation criteria. We then present a study that assesses several frameworks and compares them to Web Apps and native development. Our findings suggest that cross-platform development has seen much progress but the challenges are ever growing.

However, deciding a proper OSS to be adopted or to contribute to its development is a complex and error-prone task. Analyzing the OSS ecosystem (OSSECO) health may help providing information about: (1) the OSS itself (number of commits, days after the last release, etc.); and (2) their main actors (number of contributors, partners, etc.). There exist proposals that go further and provide aggregated high-level indicators (e.g. visibility as an aggregation of number of community events, number of partners, and other metrics). Nevertheless, there is a lack of useful OSSECO analysis tools to ease the decision making on which OSSECO has the health required by a potential OSS adopter or contributor. In this work, we provide OSS-CARE (OSSeCo heAlthy monitoR and analysEr), an OSS-independent, fully automatic, and real-time framework to assess OSSECO's health. OSS-CARE supports defining the ecosystem health objectives of potential OSS adopters, OSS contributors, and even OSS managers to inspect their provided health. These objectives are defined based on a well-established model characterizing health metrics that can be potentially aggregated by using a Bayesian network technique. Moreover, the integrated monitoring and analysis components perform an automated assessment of OSSECO's health by checking the fulfillment of the required health objectives.

These ecosystems require collaboration and interaction between diverse actors to create value. This study delves into the collaboration of such stakeholders within DT-focused ecosystems. Objective: This research aims to understand stakeholder collaboration within DT ecosystems, identify potential challenges, and provide insights for managing these stakeholders. It also seeks to define the DT ecosystem and its implications for both research and practice. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted, supplemented by empirical evidence gathered from interviews with DT experts who were knowledgeable about the DT ecosystem. The study also analyzed DT systems, stakeholder roles, and the challenges with ecosystem-focused DT development. Results: The study identified various stakeholders and their roles in adding value to a DT ecosystem. It highlighted the benefits of stakeholder collaboration, such as knowledge gain during DT system development. The research also revealed the technical and non-technical challenges encountered in ecosystem-focused DTs, emphasizing the importance of standardization as a solution. A new definition of the DT ecosystem was proposed, emphasizing its data-driven nature, interconnected DTs, stakeholder value creation, and technology enablement. Conclusion: Stakeholder collaboration is pivotal in DT ecosystems, with each actor playing a distinct role. Addressing challenges, especially through standardization (OPC UA and ISO 23247), can lead to more efficient and coherent DT ecosystems. The insights provided by this study can guide industries in designing, developing, and maintaining their DT ecosystems, ensuring value creation and stakeholder satisfaction. Future research avenues that emphasize the importance of understanding the challenges involved and deploy appropriate solutions were suggested.","Definition, Digital twin, Digital twin ecosystem, Empirical study, Software development, Stakeholders, Systematic literature review",,,,,,,,"<The industry use cases for the digital twin idea, {eid: 85076597178}>, <Digital twins: Representation, replication, reality, and relational (4rs), {eid: 85121969422}>, <Life prediction for aircraft structure based on Bayesian inference: Towards a digital twin ecosystem, {eid: 85102916934}>, <Digital twin as a service (dtaas) in industry 4.0: An architecture reference model, {eid: 85097743225}>, <Digital twin paradigm: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85105600759}>, <A vision for a platform-based digital-twin ecosystem, {eid: 85120715314}>, <Digital twin ecosystems: Potential stakeholders and their requirements, {eid: 85142720963}>, <Guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in software engineering, {eid: 44649122227}>, <Industry 4.0 as digitalization over the entire product lifecycle: Opportunities in the automotive domain, {eid: 85030650695}>, <Improving process safety: What roles for digitalization and industry 4.0?, {eid: 85074495261}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863}>, <About the importance of autonomy and digital twins for the future of manufacturing, {eid: 84953861813}>, <Digital twin requirements in the context of industry 4.0, {eid: 85058501104}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281}>, <Digital twins as software and service development ecosystems in industry 4.0: Towards a research agenda, {eid: 85090034812}>, <A review of the ecosystem concept—Towards coherent ecosystem design, {eid: 85023620022}>, <Strategy as ecology, {eid: 1642386139}>, <Construction of digital twin ecosystem for coal-fired generating units, {eid: 85102241531}>, <Next generation digital twin: An ecosystem for mechatronic systems?, {eid: 85077494977}>, <A digital twin ecosystem for additive manufacturing using a real-time development platform, {eid: 85128054645}>, <Digital twin in the IoT context: A survey on technical features, scenarios, and architectural models, {eid: 85087488936}>, <A method for evaluating rigor and industrial relevance of technology evaluations, {eid: 79951812889}>, <None, {eid: 85185390831}>, <Dtwins: A digital twins ecosystem for health and well-being, {eid: 85086723565}>, <Smart Rural Areas data infrastructure (SRADI)–An information logistics framework for digital agriculture based on open standards, {eid: 85170509398}>, <A visionary model on blockchain-based accountability for secure and collaborative digital twin environments, {eid: 85076742071}>, <Integrating crowd-/service-sourcing into digital twin for advanced manufacturing service innovation, {eid: 85115137233}>, <Living and prototyping digital twins for urban water systems: Towards multi-purpose value creation using models and sensors, {eid: 85102659264}>, <Ethertwin: Blockchain-based secure digital twin information management, {eid: 85096168791}>, <Towards information management framework for digital twin in aircraft manufacturing, {eid: 85101104051}>, <Recommended steps for thematic synthesis in software engineering, {eid: 84858743104}>, <Digital twin-driven smart manufacturing: Connotation, reference model, applications and research issues, {eid: 85070213247}>, <Substantial capabilities of robotics in enhancing industry 4.0 implementation, {eid: 85118565187}>, <Transforming Indian industries through artificial intelligence and robotics in industry 4.0, {eid: 85056276982}>, <Service network value co-creation: Defining the roles of the generic actor, {eid: 84961183561}>, <Digital twin standards, open source, and best practices, {eid: 85170193948}>, <A learning roadmap for digital lean manufacturing, {eid: 85090174676}>, <The evolution of data spaces, {eid: 85144616699}>, <Understanding the role of a digital twin in integrated vehicle health management (IVHM), {eid: 85076755246}>, <None, {eid: 0003673547}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2024-05-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85185403941

To provide valuable insights into technological environments and support researchers, we must understand the available options and gaps in this line of research. Thus, in this study, a review is conducted to map the research landscape into a coherent taxonomy. We conduct a focused search for every article related to (1) smart homes, (2) apps, and (3) IoT in three major databases, namely, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Explore. These databases contain literature focusing on smart home apps using IoT. The final dataset resulting from the classification scheme includes 229 articles divided into four classes. The first class comprises review and survey articles related to smart home IoT applications. The second class includes papers on IoT applications and their use in smart home technology. The third class contains proposals of frameworks to develop and operate applications. The final class includes studies with actual attempts to develop smart home IoT applications. We then identify the basic characteristics of this emerging field in the following aspects: motivation of using IoT in smart home applications, open challenges hindering utilization, and recommendations to improve the acceptance and use of smart home applications in literature.","Automated home, Home automation system, Intelligent home, Internet of Things (IoT), Remote home, Smart home application",,,,,,,,"<SPTP: a trust management protocol for online and ubiquitous systems, {eid: 84928635896}>, <A secure scheme for a smart house based on Cloud of Things (CoT), {eid: 84915745941}>, <Information-centric networking for M2M communications: design and deployment, {eid: 84979464870}>, <Information Centric Networking in IoT scenarios: The case of a smart home., {eid: 84953726416}>, <Cyber security challenges within the connected home ecosystem futures, {eid: 84962751782}>, <Architecture for High Density RFID Inventory System in Internet of Things., {eid: 84874685070}>, <Are Chinese consumers ready to adopt mobile smart home?

With recent developments in cloud computing and the proliferation of big data, machine learning approaches have begun to deliver invaluable insights, which drives adaptive control of battery management systems (BMS) with improved performance. In this paper, a general framework utilizing an end-edge-cloud architecture for a cloud-based BMS is proposed, with the composition and function of each link described. Cloud-based BMS leverages from the Cyber Hierarchy and Interactional Network (CHAIN) framework to provide multi-scale insights, more advanced and efficient algorithms can be used to realize the state-of-X estimation, thermal management, cell balancing, fault diagnosis and other functions of traditional BMS system. The battery intelligent monitoring and management platform can visually present battery performance, store working-data to help in-depth understanding of the microscopic evolutionary law, and provide support for the development of control strategies. Currently, the cloud-based BMS requires more effects on the multi-scale integrated modeling methods and remote upgrading capability of the controller, these two aspects are very important for the precise management and online upgrade of the system. The utility of this approach is highlighted not only for automotive applications, but for any battery energy storage system, providing a holistic framework for future intelligent and connected battery management.","Battery, Battery management system, CHAIN, Cloud, end-edge-cloud architecture, SOX estimation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85100001625}>, <None, {eid: 80053320466}>, <None, {eid: 85100586617}>, <None, {eid: 85049074030}>, <None, {eid: 85108159793}>, <None, {eid: 85038862591}>, <None, {eid: 85010073080}>, <None, {eid: 84947204025}>, <None, {eid: 85048526707}>, <None, {eid: 85086717434}>, <None, {eid: 85106303125}>, <None, {eid: 85094191785}>, <None, {eid: 84904202042}>, <None, {eid: 84863644628}>, <None, {eid: 85053817876}>, <None, {eid: 85099515265}>, <None, {eid: 85072672277}>, <None, {eid: 85110073014}>, <None, {eid: 85087179205}>, <None, {eid: 85102534647}>, <None, {eid: 84863226507}>, <None, {eid: 85083001710}>, <None, {eid: 85080064786}>, <None, {eid: 84869862215}>, <None, {eid: 85108157761}>, <None, {eid: 85085009233}>, <None, {eid: 85099786040}>, <None, {eid: 85108143251}>, <None, {eid: 85086677384}>, <None, {eid: 85088650502}>, <None, {eid: 85099688809}>, <None, {eid: 85103279226}>, <None, {eid: 85108157929}>, <None, {eid: 85079742666}>, <None, {eid: 85104000713}>, <None, {eid: 85047445540}>, <None, {eid: 84883530872}>, <None, {eid: 85108166338}>, <None, {eid: 85108150162}>, <None, {eid: 85108164881}>, <None, {eid: 85108142598}>, <None, {eid: 85030659334}>, <None, {eid: 85076867039}>, <None, {eid: 85043350464}>, <None, {eid: 85100633450}>, <None, {eid: 85055580943}>, <None, {eid: 85098168607}>, <None, {eid: 85085333874}>, <None, {eid: 85071272341}>, <None, {eid: 85064699145}>, <None, {eid: 84896811369}>, <None, {eid: 85078746508}>, <None, {eid: 84878962836}>, <None, {eid: 85043458019}>, <None, {eid: 85072916412}>, <None, {eid: 84955304218}>, <None, {eid: 85097195196}>, <None, {eid: 85053346885}>, <None, {eid: 85054627190}>, <None, {eid: 85083759438}>, <None, {eid: 84961629663}>, <None, {eid: 85079317746}>, <None, {eid: 84887089385}>, <None, {eid: 85042723175}>, <None, {eid: 85047876051}>, <None, {eid: 84992187863}>, <None, {eid: 84920997257}>, <None, {eid: 85031714237}>, <None, {eid: 85100184559}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2021-09-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85108154884

This increases the attack surface for safety and security threats. Many of these threats are at the interaction level, caused by unintended or malicious interactions between apps. Objective: Most of the current studies focus on identifying unsafe interactions between smart home apps by code analysis. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies focuses on enhancing the safety and security of smart home apps under interaction threats in the design phase. To fill this gap, this paper presents MDSSED, a safety and security enhanced model-driven development approach for smart home apps. Method: First, this paper identifies eleven types of interaction threats faced by smart home apps. Second, the MDSSED profile is proposed to support modeling smart home apps using UML. Third, the MDSSED prototype tool is developed to generate threat models and corresponding safety and security properties automatically. Then, the safety and security properties are automatically verified by model checking. Finally, the MDSSED tool automatically converts the UML models to the Samsung SmartThings apps. Results: To evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of MDSSED, this paper uses the benchmarks in existing state-of-the-art studies. The results show that MDSSED not only identified the safety and security problems in the existing benchmarks but also pointed out vulnerabilities of apps under other interaction threats identified in this paper. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, MDSSED is the first model-driven development approach that supports the automatic verification of the safety and security properties of smart home apps under interaction threats. The accuracy, practicality, and efficiency of MDSSED are corroborated by experiments. The source code of the MDSSED tool and the experimental data are available online.1","Formal method, Model-driven software development, Safety, Security, Smart home apps",,,,,,,,"<Scalable analysis of interaction threats in IoT systems, {eid: 85163432921}>, <SmartThings developers, {eid: 85163486619}>, <IFTTT, {eid: 85163524863}>, <Google home, {eid: 85110213720}>, <Microsoft flow, {eid: 85115264234}>, <How many IoT devices are there in 2021?, {eid: 85113942676}>, <Soteria: Automated IoT safety and security analysis, {eid: 85063917254}>, <IotSan: fortifying the safety of IoT systems, {eid: 85073146832}>, <None, {eid: 85163452054}>, <Cross-app interference threats in smart homes: categorization, detection and handling, {eid: 85090418412}>, <Identifying privacy weaknesses from multi-party trigger-action integration platforms, {eid: 85163549240}>, <A privacy threat analysis framework: supporting the elicitation and fulfillment of privacy requirements, {eid: 79952002261}>, <Security Requirement Modeling Support System Using Software Security Knowledge Base, {eid: 85055566296}>, <Modeling security and privacy requirements: a use case-driven approach, {eid: 85046162342}>, <Engineering requirements for system reliability and security, {eid: 69549136179}>, <On requirement verification for evolving statecharts specifications, {eid: 84906316813}>, <Semantic hierarchies for extracting, modeling, and connecting compliance requirements in information security control standards, {eid: 85039734400}>, <A Formal Methods Approach to Security Requirements Specification and Verification, {eid: 85074668081}>, <UML-SR: A Novel Security Requirements Specification Language, {eid: 85073808058}>, <Modeling dependability features for real-time embedded systems, {eid: 84925189434}>, <A security modeling and verification method of embedded software based on Z and MARTE, {eid: 85072600868}>, <Security modelling and formal verification of survivability properties: Application to cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85089137320}>, <OMG unified modeling language specification, {eid: 85146142281}>, <ContexloT: Towards providing contextual integrity to appified IoT platforms, {eid: 85159782356}>, <An extensive systematic review on the model-driven development of secure systems, {eid: 84942611940}>, <MDSSED, {eid: 85163503309}>, <Hardening machine learning denial of service (DoS) defences against adversarial attacks in IoT smart home networks, {eid: 85107799454}>, <Security analysis of emerging smart home applications, {eid: 84987660714}>, <Tizen OS: 40 new vulnerabilities, {eid: 85121316057}>, <Samsungs tizen is riddled with security flaws, amateurishly written, {eid: 85163432368}>, <Delay wreaks havoc on your smart home: Delay-based automation interference attacks, {eid: 85135894745}>, <Voiceprint mimicry attack towards speaker verification system in smart home, {eid: 85090298189}>, <Hackers use DDoS attack to cut heat to apartments, {eid: 85163442709}>, <Skill squatting attacks on Amazon Alexa, {eid: 85064687946}>, <Security analysis of emerging smart home applications, {eid: 84987660714}>, <Model driven security for process-oriented systems, {eid: 77649287144}>, <Security by design in software engineering, {eid: 85096615993}>, <NuSMV, {eid: 85163515706}>, <Eclipse papyrus, {eid: 85123564427}>, <Formal semantics of UML state diagram and automatic verification based on Kripke structure, {eid: 70350230393}>, <SmartThings developers documentation, {eid: 85163457843}>, <SmartThings groovy IDE, {eid: 85163509445}>, <Experimentation in software engineering: an introduction, {eid: 0003639957}>, <FREPA: an automated and formal approach to requirement modeling and analysis in aircraft control domain, {eid: 85097147287}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2023-11-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85163521691

All rights reserved.As business conditions change rapidly, the need for integrating business and technical systems calls for novel ICT frameworks and solutions to remain concurrent in highly competitive markets. A number of problems and issues arise in this regard. In this paper, four big challenges of enterprise information systems (EIS) are defined and discussed: (1) data value chain management; (2) context awareness; (3) usability, interaction and visualization; and (4) human learning and continuous education. Major contributions and research orientations of ICT technologies are elaborated based on selected key issues and lessons learned. First, the semantic mediator is proposed as a key enabler for dealing with semantic interoperability. Second, the context-aware infrastructures are proposed as a main solution for making efficient use of EIS to offer a high level of customization of delivered services and data. Third, the product avatar is proposed as a contribution to an evolutionary social, collaborative and product-centric and interaction metaphor with EIS. Fourth, human learning solutions are considered to develop individual competences in order to cope with new technological advances. The paper ends with a discussion on the impact of the proposed solutions on the economic and social landscape and proposes a set of recommendations as a perspective towards next generation of information systems.","Context awareness, Data value chain, Enterprise information system, Human learning, ICT, Manufacturing, Usability",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84938213364}>, <None, {eid: 84869073557}>, <What is Web 2.0?

Motivated to solve these challenges, a new technology is driving a trend that shifts the function of centralized cloud computing to edge devices of networks. Several edge computing technologies originating from different backgrounds to decrease latency, improve SE, and support the massive machine type of communication have been emerging. This paper comprehensively presents a tutorial on three typical edge computing technologies, namely mobile edge computing, cloudlets, and fog computing. In particular, the standardization efforts, principles, architectures, and applications of these three technologies are summarized and compared. From the viewpoint of radio access network, the differences between mobile edge computing and fog computing are highlighted, and the characteristics of fog computing-based radio access network are discussed. Finally, open issues and future research directions are identified as well.","Cloudlets, Fog computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile edge computing",,,,,,,,"<Recent advances in fog radio access

IoT applications often include parts in clouds and fogs as well as being part of larger cyber-physical systems; that is, these systems are very complex, which also contributes to their security problems. The design of IoT-based applications must be able to handle this complexity and heterogeneity; patterns are a good approach for this purpose because of their abstraction power. When using patterns, a good catalog is necessary. We survey and classify existing IoT security patterns to see their coverage and quality to evaluate how appropriate they are to be part of a useful catalog. A practical catalog must cover most of the standard security mechanisms. Pattern descriptions include several sections according to a template. We conclude that the number of existing patterns is insufficient for a working catalog and most of them are incomplete or use different descriptions; we need to build a unified catalog. We have started in that direction by creating new patterns or rewriting existing patterns to make them follow a common description. To use the patterns, we need a secure development methodology and we survey IoT development methodologies; we find that none of them considers security or uses patterns. As a solution, we propose modifying existing pattern-based methodologies for distributed systems, of which there is a good variety, using one of them as reference for concreteness. We provide a list of possible research directions about these topics.","Internet of Things, IoT applications, IoT survey, IoT systems design, Microservices, Misuse patterns, Privacy patterns,

Over the last few decades, the importance of software engineering in the automotive industry has increased significantly and has attracted much attention from both scholars and practitioners. A large body-of-knowledge on automotive software engineering has accumulated in several scientific publications, yet there is no systematic analysis of that knowledge. This systematic mapping study aims to classify and analyze the literature related to automotive software engineering in order to provide a structured body-of-knowledge, identify well-established topics and potential research gaps. The review includes 679 articles from multiple research sub-area, published between 1990 and 2015. The primary studies were analyzed and classified with respect to five different dimensions. Furthermore, potential research gaps and recommendations for future research are presented. Three areas, namely system/software architecture and design, qualification testing, and reuse were the most frequently addressed topics in the literature. There were fewer comparative and validation studies, and the literature lacks practitioner-oriented guidelines.

All rights reserved.Software ecosystems are becoming a common model for software development in which different actors cooperate around a shared platform. However, it is not clear what the implications are on software quality when moving from a traditional approach to an ecosystem, and this is becoming increasingly important as ecosystems emerge in critical domains such as embedded applications. Therefore, this paper investigates the challenges related to quality assurance in software ecosystems, and identifies what approaches have been proposed in the literature. The research method used is a systematic literature mapping, which however only resulted in a small set of six papers. The literature findings are complemented with a constructive approach where areas are identified that merit further research, resulting in a set of research topics that form a research agenda for quality assurance in software ecosystems. The agenda spans the entire system life-cycle, and focuses on challenges particular to an ecosystem setting, which are mainly the results of the interactions across organizational borders, and the dynamic system integration being controlled by the users.","Quality, Software ecosystems, Testing, Verification",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84960093944}>, <On the conceptual design of a dynamic component model for reconfigurable Autosar systems, {eid: 84882413955}>, <Architectural concepts for federated embedded systems, {eid: 84907415182}>, <Characteristics of software ecosystems for federated embedded systems: A case study, {eid: 84905449851}>, <A systematic mapping study on software ecosystems from a three-dimensional perspective, {eid: 84881920479}>, <Software engineering; R&D trends and defense needs, {eid: 0042825569}>, <From software product lines to software ecosystems, {eid: 77955015206}>, <From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems, {eid: 71649103965}>, <Softwares product lines, global development and ecosystems: Collaboration in software engineering, {eid: 84855447321}>, <A three-dimensional view of software ecosystems, {eid: 78149402648}>, <None, {eid: 84876027509}>, <Software assurance practices for mobile applications, {eid: 84941184913}>, <Testing requirements for mobile applications, {eid: 73949141444}>, <A formal contract language for plugin-based software engineering, {eid: 46749132692}>, <Applying systematic reviews to diverse study types: An experience report, {eid: 45449103227}>, <Architecture for embedded open software ecosystems, {eid: 84898803901}>, <A systematic review on regression test selection techniques, {eid: 70350570383}>, <Requirements value chains: Stakeholder management and requirements engineering in software ecosystems, {eid: 77955440483}>, <The evolution of the R software ecosystem, {eid: 84877268644}>, <What your plug-in test suites really test: An integration perspective on test suite understanding, {eid: 84881152989}>, <Strategy as ecology, {eid: 1642386139}>, <None, {eid: 70249090999}>, <None, {eid: 84869101278}>, <None, {eid: 84903708022}>, <None, {eid: 84867626906}>, <A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems, {eid: 70349690584}>, <Quality review and approval methods for extensions in software ecosystems, {eid: 84882020104}>, <Measuring the health of open source software ecosystems: Beyond the scope of project health, {eid: 84905495085}>, <Software engineering framework for digital service-oriented EcoSystem, {eid: 84857479026}>, <Software ecosystems - A systematic literature review, {eid: 84875249659}>, <Reviewing the health of software ecosystems - A conceptual framework proposal, {eid: 84904543421}>, <Systematic mapping studies in software engineering, {eid: 85088075417}>, <Writing good software engineering research papers: Minitutorial, {eid: 0037587229}>, <None, {eid: 0004094381}>, <The power of propagation: On the role of software operation knowledge within software ecosystems, {eid: 84855712971}>, <Monitoring ""health"" status of open source web engineering projects, {eid: 77952717012}>",,,Elsevier Inc.,,,2016-04-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-84960112461

Nearly 30 years later, that definition is taking shape and promises to alter how people live and operate. This next evolution of Internet also known as Web3.0 will combine digital and physical elements. Multiple definitions can be found in the literature, with the most prevalent being the “new internet”, among others such as “democratized virtual society”, “persistent virtual spaces”, “a digital twin of our own world for personalized value creation”. Consequently, the common consensus dictates that Metaverse can be realized as a new form of the Internet, totally reshaped from what is already known. As we are heading towards the coexistence of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 (super smart and intelligent society), this paper attempts to present the definition of Metaverse, its evolution, the advantages and disadvantages, the pillars for the technological advancement which could be the fuel to spark future investigation and discussion as well as to accelerate the development of Metaverse towards the human centric and personalized society. Furthermore, in this manuscript, challenges and opportunities are presented (including Manufacturing), a brief comparison is performed versus Virtual Reality, and a conceptual framework for integrating Metaverse in Manufacturing is also presented.","Human Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS), Metaverse, Personalization, Industry 5.0, Society 5.0",,,,,,,,"<Snow crash: a novel, {eid: 85126972472}>, <None, {eid: 85141506319}>, <None, {eid: 85141502517}>, <3D virtual worlds and the metaverse: current status and future possibilities, {eid: 84880128883}>, <Ready Player One, {eid: 84861184398}>, <Metaverse, {eid: 85126595948, doi: 10.3390/encyclopedia2010031}>, <None, {eid: 85137886807}>, <None, {eid: 85128079256}>, <Immersive netnography: a novel method for service experience research in virtual reality, augmented reality and metaverse contexts, {eid: 85127353273, doi: 10.1108/JOSM-12-2021-0481}>, <None, {eid: 85141501478}>, <None, {eid: 85141523781}>, <Simulation in the design and operation of manufacturing systems: state of the art and new trends, {eid: 85068546250, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1636321}>, <Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0—comparison, complementation and co-evolution, {eid: 85134877902, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.07.010}>, <Industry 5.0: Prospect and retrospect, {eid: 85139280032, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2022.09.017}>, <Artificial intelligence for the metaverse: a survey, {eid: 85127083376}>, <A survey on metaverse: fundamentals, security, and privacy, {eid: 85137934422, doi: 10.1109/COMST.2022.3202047}>, <Artificial intelligence for the metaverse: a survey, {eid: 85127083376}>, <None, {eid: 70350532916}>, <Polkadot: vision for a heterogeneous multi-chain framework, {eid: 85034982347}>, <None, {eid: 85141471979}>, <Virtual reality: beyond visualization, {eid: 85062983254, doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2019.01.033}>, <All one needs to know about metaverse: a complete survey on technological singularity, virtual ecosystem, and research agenda, {eid: 85127226337}>, <A metaverse: taxonomy, components, applications, and open challenges, {eid: 85122596769, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3140175}>, <3D virtual worlds and the metaverse: current status and future possibilities, {eid: 84880128883, doi: 10.1145/2480741.2480751}>, <None, {eid: 85141522006}>, <Zero defect manufacturing: state-of-the-art review, shortcomings and future directions in research, {eid: 85072947204, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2019.1605228}>, <None, {eid: 85141518731}>, <Metaverse: welcome to the new fraud marketplace, {eid: 85134203929, doi: 10.1108/JFC-06-2022-0124}>, <A futuristic perspective on human-centric assembly, {eid: 85120423661, doi: 10.1016/j.jmsy.2021.11.001}>, <None, {eid: 85141443594, doi: 10.1108/OXAN-ES270083}>, <None, {eid: 85141541693}>, <Virtual marketplace dynamics data, spatial analytics, and customer engagement tools in a real-time interoperable decentralized metaverse, {eid: 85135616545, doi: 10.22381/lpi2120227}>, <Industrial ontologies for interoperability in agile and resilient manufacturing, {eid: 85117343570, doi: 10.1080/00207543.2021.1987553}>, <An ontology for interoperability assessment: a systemic approach, {eid: 85070228513, doi: 10.1016/j.jii.2019.07.001}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2022-10-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85141526213

All rights reserved.This chapter will explore the integration of several methodologies related to source code analysis and Requirements Engineering in a software development context. The chapter will review graph-based representations of source code, alongside applied type theory (for expressing programming languages’ type systems) and systematic accounts of foundational programming elements such as functions/procedures, function calls, and inter-procedure information flows. The new representational device described here involves a theory of “channels” which permits graph-based code models to be integrated with type theories and lambda calculi structured around modern programming paradigms. The proposed techniques support documentation and verification of procedural, data type, and holistic specifications—implementational assumptions on procedures and/or modeling assumptions on types, along with larger-scale inter-type relationships. This chapter will use real-world Cyber-Physical case studies to illustrate data models which call for advanced code-documentation techniques, insofar as Cyber-Physical software should prioritize safety and reliability. For concrete examples, an accompanying open-source dataset (at https://github.com/scignscape/ntxh) demonstrates code libraries concretizing techniques outlined here.","Hypergraphs, Procedural data

Digital twin and related information technologies are widely used in the construction, operation and maintenance of infrastructure and facility. Transdisciplinary stakeholders are always involved in the long-term and cross-scene management of IoT and digital twin-enabled smart infrastructures and facilities. The intensive interactions among stakeholders often cause conflicts due to the variations in experience, knowledge, and interests. Moreover, with the change propagation of digital twins, cyber-physical resources can't be efficiently and consistently established, connected, and utilized with multi-domain information through selective simplification and structured methods. This paper proposes a Ubiquitous Digital Twin model for the information management of complex infrastructure systems based on Domain-Driven Design. To achieve the unified and structured description, six domains are deployed in the proposed model with sequential or parallel tuples for shared understanding of overall system framework or specific functional modules. Three cases of one smart nuclear plant management scenario are hierarchically instantiated to evaluate the proposed model.","Digital twin, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Industrial infrastructure

All rights reserved.In transportation cyber-physical systems (TCPS), data are collected from different transportation modes and from a wide variety of data collection devices. TCPS data have characteristics that can be described using '5Vs of big data': (1) volume, (2) variety, (3) velocity, (4) veracity and (5) value (Demchenko et al., 2013) Volume represents the raw amount of data to be stored. Velocity represents the rate at which data are being collected and inserted into the data infrastructure and how fast the back end services are expected to process these data streams. The variety aspect arises from the fact that in a data-driven environment, it is inevitable for service providers to collect and combine data from numerous different sources for creating actionable insights. As a result, data will come into the infrastructure under different data formats. With increases in data size, rate of data arrival and number of data sources, the reliability of data contents will certainly decrease. This is the veracity aspect. The final V, value, represents the desired outcome for investing in TCPS data, because all efforts are for nought if usable insights cannot be generated from the data. All of these characteristics make traditional database management systems and conventional data processing and delivery systems inappropriate for many types of transportation data analysis and decision support tasks. An enormous amount of heterogeneous data cannot be processed in real time. This chapter introduces the modern data infrastructures that are needed to support TCPS. The focus is on open-source hardware and software technologies that support data management and delivery systems. The chapter also includes a discussion of infrastructure as code that can leverage emerging commercial cloud facilities.","Cyber-physical systems, Data collection, Hadoop MapReduce, HDFS, Lambda architecture, RDBMS",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 78649992100}>, <Addressing big data issues in scientific data infrastructure, {eid: 84883290116}>, <None, {eid: 84877040956}>, <Building a replicated logging system with Apache Kafka, {eid: 84953887655}>, <The hadoop distributed file system, {eid: 77957838299}>, <An overview of the Hadoop/MapReduce/HBase framework and its current applications in bioinformatics, {eid: 78650811522}>, <A survey of stream processing, {eid: 0031295210}>, <Apache Spark, {eid: 84994589486}>, <Apache Flink: stream analytics at scale, {eid: 85047363571}>, <None, {eid: 85026960976}>, <None, {eid: 85082274678}>, <None, {eid: 85082283953}>, <Message-oriented middeware, {eid: 84923928450}>, <The google file system, {eid: 21644437974}>, <MapReduce: simplified data processing on large clusters, {eid: 37549003336}>, <Apache hadoop goes realtime at facebook, {eid: 79960018131}>, <Characterization and comparison of cloud versus grid workloads, {eid: 84870716705}>, <Apache hadoop YARN, {eid: 84917719036}>, <Discretized streams, {eid: 84889637396}>, <Hadoop-HBase for large-scale data, {eid: 84860491177}>, <The NoSQL principles and basic application of Cassandra model, {eid: 84873872672}>, <None, {eid: 84870282640}>, <None, {eid: 85026761147}>, <None, {eid: 85082271224}>, <None, {eid: 85082251676}>, <None, {eid: 85082288754}>, <None, {eid: 85082268142}>",,,Elsevier,,,2018-07-31,,,,,,,eng,,Book,,,,2-s2.0-85081895400

Published by Elsevier B.V.CNC (computer numerical control) systems play an ultimately important role for controlling EDM (electrical discharge machining) machine tools and their machining processes. Till now, existing CNC systems do not offer sufficient openness that supports researchers and engineers to expend its capabilities and functionalities in response to the increasing demands of smart manufacturing; on the other hand, transforming an EDM machine made by small and medium-sized machine tool builders, into a smart manufacturing system has never been an easy job. To address the issues and overcome the difficulties which block the way towards smart manufacturing, this paper proposes an open architecture CNC platform for EDM machine tools. This platform utilizes the state-of-the-art technologies in implementation of the hardware and software without compromising with the constraints of obsolete techniques. For demonstrating the unique capabilities, the generalized unit arc length increment (GUALI) interpolation method and the Digitizer/Player system architecture are adopted. To exhibit the feasibilities of the newly developed platform, three kinds of EDM machine tools are applied associated with advanced functionalities such as machining process adaptive control, applications of machine learning, 6-axis EDM of shrouded turbine blisks etc. In addition, a small-scale smart manufacturing unit for drilling film cooling holes of turbine blades is built up into real production by applying the new CNC system and related software applications. From the practitioner's viewpoint, openness and standardization are the keys that enable the people from academia and industry bringing in their domain knowledge to enrich the smart manufacturing ecosystem.","Application of AI, Die-sinking EDM, Digitizer/player architecture, EDM, Generalized unit arc length increment method, Machining process adaptive control, Open architecture CNC platform, Openness and standardization, Small hole fast drilling EDM, Smart manufacturing, Wire EDM",,,,,,,,"<Service innovation and smart analytics for industry 4.0 and big data environment, {eid: 84905408361}>, <Industry 4.0 technologies: Implementation patterns in manufacturing companies, {eid: 85060082633}>, <Sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0: An emerging research agenda, {eid: 85070966231}>, <A modular-architecture controller for CNC systems based on open-source electronics, {eid: 85018297953}>, <Requirements for the Design of flexible and changeable Manufacturing and Assembly Systems: A SME-survey, {eid: 84968835322}>, <Reconfigurable manufacturing potential in small and medium enterprises with low volume and high variety: Pre-design evaluation of RMS, {eid: 84986328546}>, <Adopting additive manufacturing in SMEs: Exploring the challenges and solutions, {eid: 85048362070}>, <Methodology and implementation of a vision-oriented open CNC system for profile grinding, {eid: 85061269790}>, <A cyber-physical production system framework of smart CNC machining monitoring system, {eid: 85046773292}>, <Design and development of a thermal error compensator based on CPS for CNC machine tools, {eid: 85048222447}>, <A novel efficient big data processing scheme for feature extraction in electrical discharge machining, {eid: 85063310527, doi: 10.1109/LRA.2019.2891498}>, <Estimation of machining time for CNC manufacturing using neural computing, {eid: 85016292446}>, <Stable cutting zone prediction in CNC turning using adaptive signal processing technique merged with artificial neural network and multi-objective genetic algorithm, {eid: 85043457476}>, <Hybrid processes in manufacturing, {eid: 84905924676, doi: 10.1016/j.cirp.2014.05.003}>, <Standards as a driving force that influences emerging technological trajectories in the converging world of the Internet and things: An investigation of the M2M/IoT patent network, {eid: 85020031297}>, <Technological convergence in standards for information and communication technologies, {eid: 84964510037}>, <Open architecture CNC system based on soft-integrated communication, {eid: 85049596129}>, <An extensible NC program interpreter for open CNC systems, {eid: 85027835837}>, <A new high-performance open CNC system and its energy-aware scheduling algorithm, {eid: 85020525118}>, <Design of an industrial Ethernet based embedded open architecture CNC system, {eid: 84963620697}>, <A critical review of smart manufacturing & Industry 4.0 maturity models: Implications for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), {eid: 85055904167}>, <The Russian multi-functional CNC system AxiOMA control: Practical aspects of application, {eid: 84921832948}>, <From classic CNC systems to cloud-based technology and back, {eid: 85076944432}>, <Open CNC system design for multiple intelligent functions based on TwinCAT and.

Typical streaming applications have a series-parallel dependence graph, and they are processed on a hierarchical failure-prone platform, as for instance in miniaturized satellites. The goal is to minimize the energy consumed when processing each data set, while ensuring real-time constraints in terms of processing time. Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is used to reduce the energy consumption, and we ensure a reliable execution by either executing a task at maximum speed, or by triplicating it, so that the time to execute a data set without failure is bounded. We propose a structure rule to partition the series-parallel applications and map the application onto the platform, and we prove that the optimization problem is NP-complete. We design a dynamic-programming algorithm for the special case of linear chains, which is optimal for a special class of schedules. Furthermore, this algorithm provides an interesting heuristic and a building block for designing heuristics for the general case. The heuristics are compared to a baseline solution, where each task is executed at maximum speed. Simulations on realistic settings demonstrate the good performance of the proposed heuristics; in particular, significant energy savings can be obtained.","Energy, Hierarchical platforms, Reliability, Series-parallel streaming applications, Task mapping",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85124268825}>, <None, {eid: 85124282849}>, <Tradeoff exploration between reliability, power consumption, and execution time for embedded systems, {eid: 84878113092}>, <Approximation algorithms for energy, reliability, and makespan optimization problems, {eid: 84962374493, doi: 10.1142/S0129626416500018}>, <Mapping pipeline skeletons onto heterogeneous platforms, {eid: 43049164412}>, <Traleika glacier: a hardware-software co-designed approach to exascale computing, {eid: 85013681166, doi: 10.1016/j.parco.2017.02.003}>, <CMS data processing workflows during an extended cosmic ray run, {eid: 79953278483, doi: 10.1088/1748-0221/5/03/t03006}>, <Workflow management for real-time analysis of lightsource experiments, {eid: 84988306033, doi: 10.1109/WORKS.2014.9}>, <Provenance in high-energy physics workflows, {eid: 42449137374, doi: 10.1109/MCSE.2008.81}>, <Performance estimation of streaming applications for hierarchical MPSoCs, {eid: 84961143387, doi: 10.1145/2852339.2852342}>, <A fault-tolerant MPSoC for CubeSats, {eid: 85074436279, doi: 10.1109/DFT.2019.8875417}>, <Fault-tolerant nanosatellite computing on a budget, {eid: 85124270379}>, <Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, {eid: 0003603813}>, <On reliability management of energy-aware real-time systems through task replication, {eid: 85013042453, doi: 10.1109/TPDS.2016.2600595}>, <Software pipeline–based partitioning method with trade-off between workload balance and communication optimization, {eid: 84930976078, doi: 10.4218/etrij.15.0114.0502}>, <A communication model and partitioning algorithm for streaming applications for an embedded MPSoC, {eid: 84919360592, doi: 10.1109/ISSOC.2014.6972436}>, <COLA: optimizing stream processing applications via graph partitioning, {eid: 70549086842}>, <Pilot-streaming: a stream processing framework for high-performance computing, {eid: 85088893530}>, <Support for HTCondor high-throughput computing workflows in the REANA reusable analysis platform, {eid: 85095862691}>, <Development of low power many-core soc for multimedia applications, {eid: 84885578956}>, <Evaluation of hybrid run-time power models for the ARM Big.LITTLE architecture, {eid: 84963795961, doi: 10.1109/EUC.2015.32}>, <None, {eid: 85124262190}>, <DVFS-enabled power-performance trade-off in MPSoC SW application mapping, {eid: 85050549364, doi: 10.1109/SAMOS.2017.8344628}>, <CARMEN-2: in flight observation of non destructive single event phenomena on memories, {eid: 84860180782, doi: 10.1109/RADECS.2011.6131314}>, <Optimization of duplication-based schedules on network-on-chip based multi-processor system-on-chips, {eid: 85013073520, doi: 10.1109/TPDS.2016.2599166}>, <Language and compiler support for stream programs, {eid: 77952182535}>, <NMR-MPar: a fault-tolerance approach for multi-core and many-core processors, {eid: 85044157695, doi: 10.3390/app8030465}>, <Mapping streaming applications on commodity multi-CPU and GPU on-chip processors, {eid: 84963755415, doi: 10.1109/TPDS.2015.2432809}>, <Scheduling of scientific workflows in the ASKALON grid environment, {eid: 31444449557, doi: 10.1145/1084805.1084816}>, <Minimizing energy consumption with reliability goal on heterogeneous embedded systems, {eid: 85060943290, doi: 10.1016/j.jpdc.2019.01.006}>, <A budget constrained scheduling of workflow applications on utility grids using genetic algorithms, {eid: 37149011816, doi: 10.1109/WORKS.2006.5282330}>, <Thermal-aware task scheduling for energy minimization in heterogeneous real-time MPSoC systems, {eid: 84979642418}>, <Reliability-aware dynamic energy management in dependable embedded real-time systems, {eid: 78751480345}>, <The effects of energy management on reliability in real-time embedded systems, {eid: 16244394835}>",,,Academic Press Inc.,,,2022-05-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85124296006

Tertiary studies synthesize the secondary studies to provide a holistic view of an area. Objectives: We synthesize SMSs in SE to provide insights into existing SE areas and to investigate the trends and quality of SMSs. Methodology: We use Systematic Literature Review protocol to analyze and map the SMSs in SE, till August 2017, to SE Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Results: We analyze 210 SMSs and results show that: (1) Software design and construction are most active areas in SE; (2) Some areas lack SMSs, including mathematical foundations, software configuration management, and SE tools; (3) The quality of SMSs is improving with time; (4) SMSs in journals have higher quality than SMSs in conferences and are cited more often; (5) Low quality in SMSs can be attributed to a lack of quality assessment in SMSs and not reporting information about the primary studies. Conclusion: There is a potential for more SMSs in some SE areas. A number of SMSs do not provide the required information for an SMS, which leads to a low quality score.","Secondary study, Software engineering, Survey, Systematic mapping study, Tertiary study",,,,,,,,"<A systematic literature review of software requirements prioritization research, {eid: 84897033201}>, <None, {eid: 85058847227}>, <Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, {eid: 44649122227}>, <Systematic literature reviews in software engineering – a tertiary study, {eid: 79953727654}>, <Systematic literature reviews in software engineering, {eid: 84876283132}>, <The experience factory, {eid: 0003219646}>, <Using thematic analysis in psychology, {eid: 33750505977}>, <Research synthesis in software engineering: a tertiary study, {eid: 79952446954}>, <Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), {eid: 85034769897}>, <Using mapping studies in software engineering, {eid: 77953683667}>, <A systematic tertiary study of communication in distributed software development projects, {eid: 84870715478}>, <A critical appraisal of systematic reviews in software engineering from the perspective of the research questions asked in the reviews, {eid: 78149269054}>, <Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK (R)), {eid: 0003707118}>, <Tentative guidelines to help choosing an appropriate MCDA method, {eid: 0032167344}>, <Signs of agile trends in global software engineering research: a tertiary study, {eid: 82855182101}>, <Identifying relevant studies in SE, {eid: 79953708792}>, <The impacts of agile and lean practices on project constraints: a tertiary study, {eid: 84977123198}>, <Scientific research ontology to support systematic review in software engineering, {eid: 34248665847}>, <Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: an update, {eid: 84929464206}>, <Systematic mapping studies in software engineering, {eid: 85088075417}>, <Evidence-based software engineering, {eid: 4544225764}>, <Using mapping studies as the basis for further research – a participant-observer case study, {eid: 79953724329}>, <Empirical studies omit reporting necessary details: a systematic literature review of reporting quality of empirical studies in model based testing, {eid: 85058842669}>, <Procedures for Performing Systematic Reviews, {eid: 27644567603}>, <Guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies in software engineering: an update, {eid: 84929464206}>, <Spearman correlation coefficients, differences between, {eid: 79551570488}>, <Systematic literature reviews in distributed software development: a tertiary study, {eid: 84870723249}>, <None, {eid: 85058837427}>, <Quality in model-driven engineering: a tertiary study, {eid: 84976331533}>, <Systematic literature reviews in agile software development: a tertiary study, {eid: 85009961943}>, <Systematic Reviews in the Social Sciences: A practical Guide, {eid: 84889440265}>, <Decision making with the analytic hierarchy process, {eid: 53449102906}>, <A tertiary study: experiences of conducting systematic literature reviews in software engineering, {eid: 84877258226}>, <Dealing with uncertainties in MCDA, {eid: 84955113703}>, <Applying systematic reviews to diverse study types: an experience report, {eid: 45449103227}>, <A systematic mapping study of web application testing, {eid: 84878316262}>, <A systematic literature review of literature reviews in software testing, {eid: 84987968030}>, <Systematic literature reviews in global software development: a tertiary study, {eid: 84865513218}>, <Risks and risk mitigation in global software development: a tertiary study, {eid: 84888338063}>, <Using thematic analysis in psychology, {eid: 33750505977}>, <Wilcoxon rank sum test, {eid: 84963849765}>, <Guidelines for snowballing in systematic literature studies and a replication in software engineering, {eid: 84907829939}>, <Quality assessment of systematic reviews in software engineering: a tertiary study, {eid: 85058865421}>",,,Elsevier Inc.,,,2019-03-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85058845930

Technological solutions, including software-related ones, may help tackle these concerns for humanity. However, the development of such solutions requires special attention and effort to overcome human, public, and social barriers that might prevent them from being effective. The Requirements Engineering for Well-Being, Aging, and Health (REWBAH) workshop gathering in 2021 focused on addressing the challenge of how Requirements Engineering (RE) knowledge and practices can be applied to the development of information systems that support and promote long-lasting, sustained, and healthier behavior and choices by individuals. An interactive discussion among subject matter experts and practitioners participating in the REWBAH’21 revolved around several questions. In a subsequent qualitative analysis, the emerging themes were arranged in the sustainable-health RE (SusHeRE) framework to describe RE processes that address both sustainability and health goals. In this vision paper, we present our framework, which includes four main SusHeRE goals defined according to the changes in RE that we deem necessary for achieving a positive contribution of RE on sustainability and health. These goals involve improved RE Techniques, Multidisciplinary Expertise, Education Agenda, and Public and Social Ecology.","Health, Requirements engineering, Sustainability, Well-being",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85120538358}>, <None, {eid: 85055536087}>, <Sustainability requirements for elearning systems: a systematic literature review and analysis, {eid: 85047908960}>, <Combining goal modelling with business process modelling two decades of experience with the user requirements notation standard, {eid: 85131366759}>, <The planetary wellbeing initiative: Pursuing the sustainable development goals in higher education, {eid: 85103501949}>, <None, {eid: 85034444734}>, <A roadmap for ethics-aware software engineering, {eid: 85051241187}>, <The theory of constructed emotion: an active inference account of interoception and categorization, {eid: 85032503653}>, <None, {eid: 85164226843}>, <Large-scale requirements analysis revisited: The need for understanding the political ecology of requirements engineering, {eid: 5644264607}>, <Navigating Social-Ecological Systems: Building Resilience for Complexity and Change, {eid: 0004315429}>, <None, {eid: 84863572576, doi: 10.1177/1754073912439765}>, <None, {eid: 85090496144}>, <The PERMA-profiler: A brief multidimensional measure of flourishing, {eid: 85013766167}>, <The Health Belief Model, Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice, {eid: 84995642946}>, <None, {eid: 85118468569}>, <ScholarSpace at university of hawaii at manoa: Designing information systems to break habits and promote preventive behaviours during large-scale disease outbreaks, {eid: 85164229262}>, <Non-Functional Requirements in Software Engineering, {eid: 0003696305}>, <The influence of green strategies design onto quality requirements prioritization, {eid: 85043400683}>, <None, {eid: 78650269510}>, <None, {eid: 85056845657}>, <Requirements engineering (RE) for social good: RE cares requirements, {eid: 85060556367}>, <None, {eid: 85164213334}>, <None, {eid: 85056817179}>, <Requirements engineering for sustainability: an awareness framework for designing software systems for a better tomorrow, {eid: 85089362518}>, <Drivers, barriers and impacts of digitalisation in rural areas from the viewpoint of experts, {eid: 85122935296}>, <Requirements Engineering for Digital Health, {eid: 84955360516}>, <Toward addressing social determinants of health: A health care system strategy, {eid: 85072768740}>, <Energy efficiency in software: A case study on sustainability in personal health records, {eid: 85094106180}>, <Guidelines for including grey literature and conducting multivocal literature reviews in software engineering, {eid: 85053877709}>, <None, {eid: 85164214735}>, <Vicus – a persona for towns: Towards innovation management through co-creation and predictive situation analytics, {eid: 85164218819}>, <The crowd in requirements engineering: The landscape and challenges, {eid: 85017173259}>, <Webinar, {eid: 85164217265}>, <None, {eid: 85056827057}>, <Requirements engineering in job offers, {eid: 85139057321}>, <Building mobile software ecosystems - a practical approach, {eid: 84947345023}>, <Requirements engineering course material for first-year software engineering students, {eid: 85164226000}>, <Interactive goal model analysis for early requirements engineering, {eid: 85027948067}>, <Goal-oriented requirements engineering: an extended systematic mapping study, {eid: 85029538454}>, <Robust requirements gathering for ontologies in smart water systems, {eid: 85088433095}>, <Theory of constructed emotion meets RE: An industrial case study, {eid: 85164224123}>, <Towards self-explainable adaptive systems (SEAS): A requirements driven approach, {eid: 85146940471}>, <None, {eid: 85164212818}>, <Ecological public health: the 21st centurys big idea?

The high variability poses a challenge for test engineers in selecting suitable test cases upon a change. If a requirement or a feature of a mechatronic product changes, it is not necessary to retest the whole product but only the changed parts. To identify the product features that are directly or indirectly affected by the change, a connection of test, requirement, and variant management is necessary. Therefore, an approach to select test cases based on an occurred change using variant and version knowledge is needed. In this paper, such an approach and its possible application in a toolchain are introduced. The toolchain is built by combining established tools developed by the Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) that are already used to manage parts of the product life cycle. The resulting PTC Integrity Toolchain and the applicability of the concept on it were evaluated together with industrial experts with positive results.","Computer-aided testing, Implementation of embedded computer systems, Logical design, Physical design, Product variance",,,,,,,,"<Clafer: Unifying class and feature modeling, {eid: 84917709136}>, <A model-based design methodology for the development of mechatronic systems, {eid: 84908118240}>, <A survey of variability modeling in industrial practice, {eid: 84891549777}>, <Experience with variability management in requirement specifications, {eid: 80054058104}>, <Regression test selection and product line system testing, {eid: 77954527991}>, <Interdisciplinary product lines to support the engineering in the machine manufacturing domain, {eid: 84978730681}>, <Hierarchical variability modeling for software architectures, {eid: 80054066165}>, <Feature-oriented evolution of automation software systems in industrial software ecosystems, {eid: 85057220887}>, <None, {eid: 85105052188, doi: 10.24355/dbbs.084-201802071247}>, <None, {eid: 85105091323}>, <175% modeling for product-line evolution of domain artifacts, {eid: 85044349813}>, <Applying Model-based Software Product Line Testing Approaches to the Automation Engineering Domain, {eid: 84910112432}>, <Software product line engineering and variability management: Achievements and challenges, {eid: 84924174468}>, <Generating an Object Oriented IEC 61131-3 software product line architecture from SysML, {eid: 84890720368}>, <Systematic interdisciplinary reuse within the engineering of automated plants, {eid: 84941313095}>, <Automatic test case generation from requirements for industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84961828432}>, <FeatureIde: An extensible framework for feature-oriented software development, {eid: 84885591794}>, <Evolution of software in automated production systems - Challenges and Research Directions, {eid: 84944029939}>, <Automated test case selection using feature model: An industrial case study, {eid: 84886852777}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2020-07-12,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85105089818

These processes are complex and time-consuming and tool support can greatly aid in their execution. In line with other trends for systems and software engineering, the need for and interest in open source tools for assurance and certification is growing and different initiatives have been launched. As a concrete example, we report on our experience in developing the AMASS open source ecosystem. This ecosystem includes (1) an open source tool platform that supports the main CPS assurance and certification activities, (2) external tools with added-value features, and (3) an open community of developers and users. The platform integrates existing solutions for system modelling, process engineering, and compliance and argumentation management. We also present the application of the AMASS tool platform in 11 industrial case studies from five different application domains. The results show that the platform is a feasible means for CPS assurance and certification and that practitioners find benefits in assurance-oriented system modelling and in integrated system assurance information, among other areas. Nonetheless, improvement opportunities also exist, most notably regarding tool interoperability and usability.","AMASS, Assurance, Certification, Cyber–physical\u200b system, Ecosystem, Open source",,,,,,,,"<ASCE software, {eid: 85090417068}>, <WEFACT, {eid: 85090415392}>, <Enabling system artefact exchange and selection through a linked data layer, {eid: 85063047015}>, <Understanding governance mechanisms and health in software ecosystems: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85048976751}>, <Deliverable D1.1 -

Managing these “things” is still considered a challenge. One way to overcome this challenge may be by adopting the software product line (SPL) paradigm and the variability management (VM) activity. SPL engineering consists of mechanisms that provide identification, representation, and traceability, which may be helpful to “things” management supported by VM organizational and technical activities. Objective: This research aims to investigate how SPL engineering has been applied along with the IoT paradigm, as well as how VM is being carried out. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted considering papers available until March 2019. This systematic review identified 1039 papers. After eliminating the duplicated titles and the ones not related to the review, 112 papers remained. The number of papers was narrowed to 56 after applying the exclusion criteria. Results: The results provide evidence on the diversity of proposed SPLs used to specify approaches for managing IoT systems. However, most SPLs and research developed for IoT lack a systematic and detailed specification to ensure their quality, as well as tailoring guidelines for further use.","Families of systems, Internet

Formal and semi-formal languages, techniques, tools and frameworks can assist by providing repeatable and rigorous structures for eliciting, specifying, analysing, verifying and maintaining requirements. Various approaches have been proposed, but a contemporary and comprehensive study providing a landscape of the state-of-the-art is currently missing. This article reports a systematic mapping study covering 93 primary studies published between 2009 and October 2020. We categorise surveyed studies by current research directions in the use of semi-formal and formal methods for Requirements Engineering phases for Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. We also identify gaps in current research and develop a novel conceptual model capturing the relationship between available formalisms and Requirements Engineering activities. We find that extensive work has been carried out on the formal analysis and verification of safety and timings requirements. However, the use of semi-formal notations, works on key phases like requirements elicitation and management, and the adoption of industrial standards are largely missing. Moreover, we find no literature providing methods to handle privacy and trust requirements, which have become critical concerns in this area.","Formal methods, Industrial Cyber-Physical system, Requirements engineering, Semi-formal methods, Systematic mapping study",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 51249099012}>, <Model-based security analysis of a water treatment system, {eid: 84973450834}>, <Introducing cyber security at the design stage of public infrastructures: A procedure and case study, {eid: 85133311251}>, <An investigation into the response of a water treatment system to cyber attacks, {eid: 84962834058}>, <None, {eid: 84969927144}>, <Behavior modeling and verification of movement authority scenario of Chinese train control system using AADL, {eid: 84946532362, doi: 10.1007/s11432-015-5346-2}>, <Simulation in business and industry: How simulation context can affect simulation practice?, {eid: 85015917992}>, <Model-checking BNDC properties in cyber-physical systems, {eid: 70449642871}>, <Systems engineering for industrial cyber-physical systems using aspects, {eid: 84961937815, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2015.2512265}>, <Formal methods in designing critical cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85073674682}>, <None, {eid: 85133318762}>, <06).

However, just working on different concerns of a system in a collaborative way is not good enough for economically feasible tailored solutions. A successful approach for this is the composition of complex systems out of commodity building blocks. These come as is and can be represented as blocks with ports via data sheets. Data sheets are models and allow a proper selection and configuration as well as the prediction of the behavior of a building block in a specific context. This chapter explains how model-driven approaches can be used to support separation of roles and composition for robotics software systems. The models, open-source tools, open-source robotics software components and fully deployable robotics software systems shape a robotics software ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85164755308}>, <None, {eid: 54249093500}>, <None, {eid: 84870830010}>, <None, {eid: 85164759850}>, <Challenges and future perspectives for the life cycle of manufacturing networks in the mass customisation era, {eid: 84953274656}>, <None, {eid: 85093365111}>, <Predators and prey: A new ecology of competition, {eid: 0027603238}>, <None, {eid: 84989848908}>, <Dynamic software product lines, {eid: 84904392607}>, <From software product lines to software ecosystems, {eid: 77955015206}>, <None, {eid: 84892029522}>, <None, {eid: 85164756793}>, <From integration to composition: On the impact of software product lines, global development and ecosystems, {eid: 71649103965}>, <Model-driven software systems engineering in robotics: Covering the complete life-cycle of a robot, {eid: 84996568815}>, <Separating computation, coordination and configuration, {eid: 0036760996}>, <None, {eid: 79957551757}>, <Service robot control architectures for flexible and robust real-world task execution: Best practices and patterns, {eid: 84922551823}>, <None, {eid: 0004101993}>, <None, {eid: 85164757802}>, <Hierarchical hypergraphs for knowledge-centric robot systems: A composable structural meta-model and its domain specific language NPC4, {eid: 85042219315}>, <None, {eid: 85164753534}>, <Encapsulated hierarchical graphs, graph types, and meta types, {eid: 0010140856}>, <An object-oriented data model formalised through hypergraphs, {eid: 0026157772}>, <None, {eid: 0003562903}>, <A classification framework for software component models, {eid: 80053615106}>, <None, {eid: 84883406802}>, <None, {eid: 33645569125}>, <The SmartMDSD toolchain: An integrated MDSD workflow and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Robotics Software, {eid: 85015947464}>, <None, {eid: 85164760553}>, <Runtime monitoring of robotics software components: Increasing robustness of service robotic systems, {eid: 84255178463}>, <None, {eid: 85164758956}>, <None, {eid: 85164758386}>, <Combining robotics component-based model-driven development with a model-based performance analysis, {eid: 85015863144}>, <None, {eid: 85164754727}>, <Managing execution variants in task coordination by exploiting designtime models at runtime, {eid: 84455206201}>, <None, {eid: 85164759192}>, <Robotics middleware: A comprehensive literature survey and attributebased bibliography, {eid: 84872295345}>, <Model-driven software development approaches in robotics research, {eid: 84941925888}>, <A survey on modeling and model-driven engineering practices in the embedded software industry, {eid: 85053702722}>, <Computer-Assisted Engineering for Robotics and Autonomous Systems, {eid: 85164756866}>, <None, {eid: 85103865896}>, <None, {eid: 85064140714}>, <None, {eid: 85164756634}>",,,Springer International Publishing,,,2021-07-05,,,,,,,eng,,Book,,,,2-s2.0-85164758399

Over the years, some of the UbiComp features presented in that paper have been gradually adopted by industry players in the technology market. While this technological evolution resulted in many benefits to our society, it has also posed, along the way, countless challenges that we have yet to surpass. In this paper, we address major challenges from areas that most afflict the UbiComp revolution: 1.Software Protection: weakly typed languages, polyglot software, and networked embedded systems.2.Long-term Security: recent advances in cryptanalysis and quantum attacks.3.Cryptography Engineering: lightweight cryptosystems and their secure implementation.4.Resilience: issues related to service availability and the paramount role of resilience.5.Identity Management: requirements to identity management with invisibility.6.Privacy Implications: sensitivity data identification and regulation.7.Forensics: trustworthy evidence from the synergy of digital and physical world. We point out directions towards the solutions of those problems and claim that if we get all this right, we will turn the science fiction of UbiComp into science fact.","Cryptography, Forensics,

Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today’s value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between “everything”, IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytic tools are able to extract “sense” from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.","Big Data, Data science, Internet of Things, Smart factories, Software platforms",,,,,,,,"<Open source big data projects—emergence of the converged data platform, {eid: 85045966049}>, <Build vs, {eid: 85045963048}>, <An executive’s guide to the Internet of Things The rate of adoption is accelerating.

New IT trends have an important impact on IT infrastructures, which become increasingly heterogeneous, flexible, and dynamic. These new trends are transforming Information Systems into what we call Pervasive Information Systems. The purpose of this book is to combine “state-of-the-art” solutions from various research communities (such as Information Systems Engineering, Cloud Computing, Fog/Edge Computing, Pervasive systems, Distributed systems, and Middleware systems) related to the Pervasive Information Systems emergence as a common point of view. Through these multiple contributions, this book tackles important challenges concerning Information Systems evolution, promoting a holistic view of Pervasive Information System.Pervasive Information Systems (PIS) can be defined as a new class of Information Systems. It can be characterized by an IT that is gradually embedded in the physical environment and can accommodate the user’s requirements and desires when necessary. This evolution implies considering Information Systems beyond the organization’s physical environment to integrate new technologies transparently, leading to a pervasive environment whose behavior should be more and more reactive and proactive. It corresponds to an important change in Information Systems Engineering. Pervasive Information Systems are deeply multidisciplinary systems, demanding a holistic view in which multiple domains are invited to contribute.","Adaptability, Context-Aware Computing, Edge Computing, Green IT, Industry 4.0, Information System, IoT, Machine Learning, middleware, Pervasive Computing, Self-Adapting Systems, Service Oriented Architecture, Systems-of- Information Systems, Ubiquitous Computing",,,,,,,,None,,,Springer International Publishing,,,2023-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Book,,,,2-s2.0-85160134923

In order to obtain healthcare big data by sustainable health monitoring, we design “Smart Clothing”, facilitating unobtrusive collection of various physiological indicators of human body. To provide pervasive intelligence for smart clothing system, mobile healthcare cloud platform is constructed by the use of mobile internet, cloud computing and big data analytics. This paper introduces design details, key technologies and practical implementation methods of smart clothing system. Typical applications powered by smart clothing and big data clouds are presented, such as medical emergency response, emotion care, disease diagnosis, and real-time tactile interaction. Especially, electrocardiograph signals collected by smart clothing are used for mood monitoring and emotion detection. Finally, we highlight some of the design challenges and open issues that still need to be addressed to make smart clothing ubiquitous for a wide range of applications.","Big data, Cloud computing, Health monitoring, Smart clothing, Wearable computing",,,,,,,,"<Stretchable electronics: materials, architectures and integrations, {eid: 84857736672}>, <Prevention of chronic disease in the 21st century: elimination of the leading preventable causes of premature death and disability in the usa, {eid: 84903778851}>, <Virtual reality technology, {eid: 84859519349}>, <Elderly population health status survey, {eid: 84991018006}>, <None, {eid: 84990878325}>, <Wearable computing for health care, {eid: 84958050561}>, <NDNC-BAN: supporting rich media healthcare services via named data networking in cloud-assisted wireless body area networks, {eid: 84906782809}>, <A 2g-rfid-based e-healthcare system, {eid: 77649143550}>, <Body area networks: A survey, {eid: 79956094375}>, <Enabling technologies for future data center networking: a primer, {eid: 84881526250}>, <Song E (2013b) Rochas: robotics and cloud-assisted healthcare system for empty nester, {eid: 84925280117}>, <Big data: A survey, {eid: 84898796363}>, <Big data: related technologies, challenges and future prospects, {eid: 84905021679}>, <A survey of recent developments in home m2m networks, {eid: 84894170460}>, <On the computation offloading at ad hoc cloudlet: architecture and service modes, {eid: 84933041327}>, <Demo: Lives: Learning through interactive video and emotion-aware system.

It is a timely compilation of well-established and cutting-edge approaches that can be leveraged by those facing the prevailing and daunting challenge of re-engineering their systems into SPLs. The selection of chapters provides readers with a wide and diverse perspective that reflects the complementary and varied expertise of the chapter authors. This perspective covers the re-engineering processes, from planning to execution. SPLs are families of systems that share common assets, allowing a disciplined software reuse. The adoption of SPL practices has shown to enable significant technical and economic benefits for the companies that employ them. However, successful SPLs rarely start from scratch, but instead, they usually start from a set of existing systems that must undergo well-defined re-engineering processes to unleash new levels of productivity and competitiveness. Practitioners will benefit from the lessons learned by the community, captured in the array of methodological and technological alternatives presented in the chapters of the handbook, and will gain the confidence for undertaking their own re-engineering challenges. Researchers and educators will find a valuable single-entry point to quickly become familiar with the state-of-the-art on the topic and the open research opportunities; including undergraduate, graduate students, and R&D engineers who want to have a comprehensive understanding of techniques in reverse engineering and re-engineering of variability-rich software systems.","Artificial intelligence, Configurable systems, Configuration management, Customization, Domain analysis, Feature localization, Feature models, Feature-oriented development, Information retrieval, Machine learning, Microservices, Model-driven engineering, Requirements engineering, Reverse engineering, Software engineering, Software mining, Software product lines, Software reuse, Variability management",,,,,,,,None,,,Springer International Publishing,,,2022-11-22,,,,,,,eng,,Book,,,,2-s2.0-85160496931

Available models, transformations, code generators, and a wide range of corresponding software tools constitute the definition of modeling ecosystems. Automatically understanding and analyzing the modeling artifacts available in the modeling ecosystem of interest are preparatory for simplifying their management, including their exploration and evolution. Machine learning (ML) has garnered attention from the scientific community due to its ability to obtain unprecedented results and performance compared with conventional approaches. ML algorithms have been conceived to simulate the learning activities of humans, being capable of autonomously extracting meaningful patterns from data. Deep learning (DL) algorithms go one step further to learn from highly complex data, exploiting deep neural networks with several layers. Over the last few years, the MDE community investigated the adoption of ML/DL techniques to support the management of modeling ecosystems, e.g., by conceiving different types of neural networks to facilitate the automated classification of model repositories or develop recommender systems. This chapter summarizes the recent applications of machine learning approaches to support modeling ecosystems. Furthermore, it identifies possible lines of research that can be followed to further explore to what extent the management of modeling ecosystems can be enhanced by adopting existing machine learning techniques. In this respect, our work envisions a roadmap for the deployment of various ML/DL techniques in the MDE domain.",,,,,,,,,"<Towards machine learning for learnability of MDD tools, {eid: 85071359227}>, <Predicting hurricane trajectories using a recurrent neural network, {eid: 85087975283}>, <Review of deep learning: Concepts, CNN architectures, challenges, applications, future directions, {eid: 85103843272}>, <Statistical analysis of large sets of models, {eid: 84989186712}>, <An automated approach to generate SysML models from restricted natural language requirements (in Chinese), {eid: 85104131599}>, <AI-powered model repair: An experience report-lessons learned, challenges, and opportunities, {eid: 85124985776}>, <Automated clustering of metamodel repositories, {eid: 84976614553}>, <Promoting social diversity for the automated learning of complex MDE artifacts, {eid: 85123063597}>, <A survey of clustering data mining techniques, {eid: 84892062680}>, <None, {eid: 0003487601}>, <Towards a better understanding of interactions with a domain modeling assistant, {eid: 85096756949}>, <Automatic assessment of students’ software models using a simple heuristic and machine learning, {eid: 85096797563}>, <Who is behind the model?

In this publication, we share our software development experiences from the Digital Villages project. The major goal in this project is to support rural areas with digital services running on a platform. While typical software engineering activities such as design, implementation, or testing are, of course, necessary further on, evaluation and incorporating feedback from users play a far more important role when going towards digital ecosystems.

For instance, software product line engineering—an approach to systematically develop portfolios of products—is difficult to adopt given the high upfront investments; and even when adopted, organizations are challenged by evolving their complex product lines. Consequently, the research community now mainly focuses on re-engineering and evolution techniques for product lines; yet, understanding the current state of adoption and the industrial challenges for organizations is necessary to conceive effective techniques. In this multiple-case study, we analyze the current adoption of variability management techniques in twelve medium- to large-scale industrial cases in domains such as automotive, aerospace or railway systems. We identify the current state of variability management, emphasizing the techniques and concepts they adopted. We elicit the needs and challenges expressed for these cases, triangulated with results from a literature review. We believe our results help to understand the current state of adoption and shed light on gaps to address in industrial practice.","Challenges, Multiple-case study, Software product lines, Variability

The security design patterns enable the detection of anomalies in the firmware at boot, ensure secure communication in the vehicle and detect anomalies in in-vehicle communications, prevent unauthorized electronic control units from successfully transmitting messages, provide a way to transmit and aggregate security-related events within a vehicle network, and report to entities external to the vehicle.

The nuclear DT uses real-time information and other data sources to improve the process of design, licensing, construction, security, O&M, decommissioning, and waste disposal. By leveraging the knowledge base and experience from the past 40 years of LWR operation, the nuclear DT is helping to accelerate the development and deployment of advanced nuclear technology in areas of passive safety, new fuel forms, instrumentation, and reactor control. For the currently operating nuclear fleet, DTs are reducing the operational risks, increasing plant availability, increasing energy capability, and reducing electricity production costs. For advanced fission and fusion reactors, DTs are being used to design for passive safety and built-in security-by-design. Rapidly deployable small modular reactor (SMR) and microreactor designs compatible with modular construction techniques and advanced manufacturing will be the new normal, reducing the need for large capital expenditures and compressing construction schedules. In addition, lower operational and maintenance costs will be realized by reducing the complexity of operations, staffing needs, and maintenance-related activities.","Decommissioning, Digital Twin, Dual Coolant Lead-Lithium (DCLL), Fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR), Fusion Energy Reactor Models Integrator (FERMI), High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR), Light-Water Reactor (LWR), Liquid Metal cooled nuclear Reactor (LMR), Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) Lifecycle, Operation & Maintainance (O&M), Quality Assurance (QA), Small Modular Reactor (SMR), Special Nuclear Material (SNM), Virtual Environment for Reactions Applications (VERA)",,,,,,,,"<Wireless online position monitoring of manual valve types for plant configuration management in nuclear power plants, {eid: 85027526360}>, <ParaView: An end-user tool for large data visualiza-tion, {eid: 84882899235}>, <None, {eid: 85026865689}>, <None, {eid: 85116164775}>, <FERMI: Fusion Energy Reactor Models Integrator, {eid: 85150897850}>, <None, {eid: 85107811048}>, <PreCICE - A fully parallel library for multi-physics surface coupling, {eid: 84965137979}>, <The advanced tokamak path to a compact net electric fusion pilot plant, {eid: 85103181593}>, <Toward full simulations for a liquid metal blan-ket: MHD flow computations for a PbLi blanket prototype at ha∼ 104, {eid: 85086584600}>, <Incorporating equipment condition assessment in risk monitors for advanced small modular reactors, {eid: 84883826815}>, <BLUEPRINT: A novel approach to fusion reactor design, {eid: 85059124955}>, <None, {eid: 85170188642}>, <None, {eid: 85170176326}>, <None, {eid: 85170184626}>, <DEMO design activity in Europe: Progress and updates, {eid: 85047948300}>, <None, {eid: 85170187780}>, <On the implementa-tion of new technology modules for fusion reactor systems codes, {eid: 84942550911}>, <Ultrasonic cavi-tation monitoring by acoustic noise power measurement, {eid: 0033777988}>, <None, {eid: 84902251069}>, <Demonstration of the advanced dynamic system modeling tool TRANSFORM in a molten salt reactor applica-tion via a model of the molten salt demonstration reactor, {eid: 85068777764}>, <None, {eid: 85118114191}>, <Time-dependent reliability analysis of nuclear hybrid energy systems, {eid: 85063136524}>, <None, {eid: 85170185901}>, <An asynchronous analog self-powered CMOS sensor-data-logger with a 13.56 MHz RF programming interface, {eid: 84856455418}>, <None, {eid: 85170180173}>, <Pyroelectric energy scavenging techniques for self-powered nuclear reactor wireless sensor networks, {eid: 84918830798}>, <None, {eid: 84954418337}>, <None, {eid: 10644278215}>, <None, {eid: 85170183971}>, <None, {eid: 85047834251}>, <Software-defined networking: A comprehensive survey, {eid: 84919935425}>, <None, {eid: 85131232100}>, <A state-of-the-art survey of digital twin: Techniques, engineering product lifecycle management, and business innovation per-spectives, {eid: 85075384583}>, <None, {eid: 85100373155}>, <CFETR integration design platform: Overview and recent progress, {eid: 85061353803}>, <A micro-fabricated current sensor for arc fault detection of aircraft wiring, {eid: 58149083758}>, <Ultra-wideband communications: An overview, {eid: 84862607815}>, <Fabrication of low-cost surface acoustic wave sensors using direct printing by aerosol inkjet, {eid: 85045195907}>, <None, {eid: 84897759745}>, <Design considerations for secure wireless sensor communication systems in harsh electromagnetic environments of nuclear reactor facilities, {eid: 85053541060}>, <None, {eid: 85170178640}>, <None, {eid: 85170179540}>, <Physics-informed reinforcement learning optimiza-tion of nuclear assembly design, {eid: 85097477918}>, <None, {eid: 85106624960}>, <None, {eid: 85170194213}>, <SHM by DOFS in civil engineering: A review, {eid: 84994891504}>, <None, {eid: 84885778926}>, <None, {eid: 85170156888}>, <Cavitation model calibra-tion using machine learning assisted workflow, {eid: 85097287766}>, <Dual-coolant Lead-lith-ium (DCLL) blanket status and R&D needs, {eid: 84940675568}>, <SAW synchronous multimode resonator with gold electrodes on quartz, {eid: 44949200075}>, <ARC: A compact, high-field, fusion nuclear science facility and demonstration power plant with demountable magnets, {eid: 84928900082}>, <Condition monitoring of a prototype turbine.

That is, the products themselves often need to be variable-as in a car plant producing many similar, albeit not identical cars. Such flexibility allows a product to be more easily customizable. We speak of variable products.At the same time, production systems typically need to be flexible in supporting the production of different products. Such flexibility allows for a broader use of production systems, supports lower production volumes while remaining economical, or optimizes production resources to avoid delays. We speak of variable production. This chapter explores variability in products and variability during production where product variability needs to be understood together with its implications on production. Special considerations are products that are consequently used during production and the issue of hardware/software variability, which is mostly handled separately today. We provide examples from an injection molding machine and also discuss open research challenges.","Product lines, Products and production systems, Variability, Variability engineering",,,,,,,,"<Change impact analysis for maintenance and evolution of variable software systems, {eid: 85061174900}>, <Identifying inactive code in product lines with configuration-aware system dependence graphs, {eid: 84907807523}>, <None, {eid: 84881286743}>, <What is a feature?

In this work we investigate the use of software product line engineering in one of these new domains, synthetic biology. In synthetic biology living organisms are programmed to perform new functions or improve existing functions. These programs are designed and constructed using small building blocks made out of DNA. We conjecture that there are families of products that consist of common and variable DNA parts, and we can leverage product line engineering to help synthetic biologists build, evolve, and reuse DNA parts. In this paper we perform an investigation of domain engineering that leverages an open-source repository of more than 45,000 reusable DNA parts. We show the feasibility of these new types of product line models by identifying features and related artifacts in up to 93.5% of products, and that there is indeed both commonality and variability. We then construct feature models for four commonly engineered functions leading to product lines ranging from 10 to 7.5 × 1020 products. In a case study we demonstrate how we can use the feature models to help guide new experimentation in aspects of application engineering. Finally, in an empirical study we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of automated reverse engineering on both complete and incomplete sets of products. In the process of these studies, we highlight key challenges and uncovered limitations of existing SPL techniques and tools which provide a roadmap for making SPL engineering applicable to new and emerging domains.","BioBricks, Reverse engineering, Software product lines, Synthetic biology",,,,,,,,"<Reverse engineering architectural feature models, {eid: 80053209838}>, <Towards a conceptual model for unifying variability in space and time, {eid: 85117538987}>, <None, {eid: 84867481198}>, <Engineering and ethical perspectives in synthetic biology, {eid: 84863315813, doi: 10.1038/embor.2012.81}>, <Molecular design for recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector production, {eid: 85036578353, doi: 10.1007/s00253-017-8670-1}>, <ASU iGEM 2017: Engineering variable regulators for a quorum sensing toolbox, {eid: 85103405621}>, <Multi-objective reverse engineering of variability-safe feature models based on code dependencies of system variants, {eid: 84991821880, doi: 10.1007/s10664-016-9462-4}>, <A software product line process to develop agents for the IoT, {eid: 84936970589, doi: 10.3390/s150715640}>, <A first step towards a framework for the automated analysis of feature models, {eid: 51649115041}>, <FAMA: Tooling a framework for the automated analysis of feature models, {eid: 55049135676}>, <Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later: a literature review, {eid: 77955227439, doi: 10.1016/j.is.2010.01.001}>, <Environmental sensing of heavy metals through whole cell microbial biosensors: a synthetic biology approach, {eid: 84929601002, doi: 10.1021/sb500286r}>, <A DNA-based archival storage system, {eid: 85101483198, doi: 10.1145/2980024.2872397}>, <GenoCAD for iGEM: a grammatical approach to the design of standard-compliant constructs, {eid: 77952526654, doi: 10.1093/nar/gkq086}>, <A brief history of synthetic biology, {eid: 84899079198, doi: 10.1038/nrmicro3239}>, <None, {eid: 85117541910}>, <Using feature models for developing self-configuring smart homes, {eid: 67650659739}>, <Dronology: An incubator for cyber-physical systems research, {eid: 85049695714}>, <None, {eid: 0004161809}>, <The AETG system: an approach to testing based on combinatorial design, {eid: 0000673732, doi: 10.1109/32.605761}>, <A formal model for multi software product lines, {eid: 85058688719, doi: 10.1016/j.scico.2018.11.005}>, <Synthetic analog computation in living cells, {eid: 84878381909, doi: 10.1038/nature12148}>, <A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators, {eid: 0034688173, doi: 10.1038/35002125}>, <The assurance recipe: Facilitating assurance patterns, {eid: 85053934660}>, <Freiburg bioware iGEM 2010: Virus construction kit for therapy, {eid: 85103414819}>, <Debian packages repositories as software product line models.

The proposed method incorporates a complex three-step procedure—sensitivity assessment, polynomial interpolation with noise calibration, and perturbed data generation—to address the challenging trade-off between privacy and utility. The framework guarantees the security of sensitive medical information while making the most of the data by maintaining the original dataset's geographical structure and using differential privacy standards. The suggested approach outperforms conventional perturbation processes in experimental evaluations, displaying improved privacy protection and low time consumption. In order to preserve the original data distribution, the study stresses the need of choosing suitable privacy budgets (ε values) that are customised to meet the demands of each application. Encouraging safe and effective data processing in healthcare settings, the framework is a giant leap forward in resolving privacy issues in the ever-changing world of digital 6G IoT-based cyber-physical systems, especially as they pertain to medical big data applications.","Big data application, Digital 6G IoT based cyber physical systems in medicine, Homomorphic encryption, Privacy preserving",,,,,,,,"<A fully homomorphic encryption scheme, {eid: 84918557568}>, <Public-key cryptosystems based on composite degree residuosity classes, {eid: 84942550998}>, <A public key cryptosystem and a signature scheme based on discrete logarithms, {eid: 84874800178, doi: 10.1109/TIT.1985.1057074}>, <Homomorphic encryption-based privacy-preserving federated learning in 6G IoT-enabled healthcare system, {eid: 85133787154, doi: 10.1109/TNSE.2022.3185327}>, <Homomorphic encryption for Digital 6G IoT based cyber physical systems in medicine and bioinformatics, {eid: 85092190064, doi: 10.1145/3394658}>, <Practical privacy-preserving data science with homomorphic encryption: An overview, {eid: 85103816056}>, <Convergence of blockchain, k-medoids and homomorphic encryption for privacy preserving biomedical data classification, {eid: 85150027619, doi: 10.1016/j.iotcps.2022.05.006}>, <None, {eid: 85193060549}>, <Privacy-preserving deep learning techniques for wearable sensor-based Big Data applications, {eid: 85193055369, doi: 10.1016/j.vrih.XXXX}>, <Privacy-preserving deep learning with homomorphic encryption: An introduction, {eid: 85135323379, doi: 10.1109/MCI.2022.3180883}>, <An efficient privacy-preserving deep learning scheme for medical image analysis, {eid: 85099865753}>, <A homomorphic encryption approach for privacy-preserving deep learning in digital health care service, {eid: 85145260643}>, <Towards secure big data analysis via fully homomorphic encryption algorithms, {eid: 85128629388, doi: 10.3390/e24040519}>, <Ensemble method for privacy-preserving logistic regression based on homomorphic encryption, {eid: 85052690657, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866697}>, <PPD-6G IoTCPS algorithms for big data systems.

Indeed, we position the adoption of a Pure Edge Computing platform that offers designing and programming abstractions to specify, implement and operate Future Internet applications.",,,,,,,,,"<A view of cloud computing, {eid: 77950347409}>, <Choreos: Large scale choreographies for the future internet, {eid: 84898426562}>, <The architecture of platforms: A unified view, {eid: 71949126345}>, <Achieving self-adaptation through dynamic group management, {eid: 84873868319}>, <The semantic web, {eid: 79551602978}>, <Fog computing and its role in the internet of things, {eid: 84866627419}>, <Contributing to the internet of things, {eid: 84928330328}>, <Reinforcement learning techniques for decentralized self-adaptive service assembly, {eid: 85007300645}>, <PaCE: A data-flow coordination language for asynchronous network-based applications, {eid: 84862190657}>, <Engineering future internet applications: The prime approach, {eid: 84930813995}>, <A decentralized approach to network-aware service composition, {eid: 84944731704}>, <Adaptable service composition for very-large-scale Internet of Things systems, {eid: 84856655935}>, <Exploiting ADLs to specify architectural styles induced by middleware infrastructures, {eid: 0032667363}>, <Efficient semantic-based IoT service discovery mechanism for dynamic environments, {eid: 84944324361}>, <Brewer’s conjecture and the feasibility of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services, {eid: 1542640153}>, <A perspective on the future of middleware-based software engineering, {eid: 34748852148}>, <A sense of community: A research agenda for software ecosystems, {eid: 70349690584}>, <Edge-centric computing: Vision and challenges, {eid: 84977268028}>, <None, {eid: 79952362675}>, <None, {eid: 79959926796}>, <Communities in networks, {eid: 70349607513}>, <Mobile computing: The next decade, {eid: 77955008966}>, <Open services for IoT cloud applications in the future internet, {eid: 84883705304}>, <Scalable distributed computing hierarchy: Cloud, fog and dew computing, {eid: 85001001958}>, <Distributed operating systems, {eid: 0022286291}>, <Eventually consistent, {eid: 58849109112}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,2016-07-04,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85007340627

This trend, combined with the fact that increasingly powerful embedded devices are added to these systems opens up many new opportunities for the development of richer and more complex CPS services. This, however, introduces several new challenges with respect to the data and software managed on these CPS devices and gateways. This paper proposes a platform for the development of secure cyber-physical devices and gateways. The platform provides a secure environment in which critical CPS services can be running. The secure environment relies on the ARM TrustZone security extensions. A commodity Android environment is provided in which the user can install additional software components to extend the functionality of the devices. A prototype of the platform is developed and this prototype is evaluated.","Android, CPS, Embedded system, Genode, Security, TrustZone",,,,,,,,"<On the security of public key protocols, {eid: 0020720357}>, <None, {eid: 85041553781}>, <None, {eid: 85041504472}>, <SPROBES: Enforcing kernel code integrity on the trustzone architecture, {eid: 84919328813}>, <InkTag: Secure applications on an untrusted operating system, {eid: 84875683130}>, <A quick tour of the verifast program verifier, {eid: 78650758238}>, <Winwood, S.: SeL4: Formal verification of an OS kernel, {eid: 72249120603}>, <None, {eid: 85041515801}>, <Security and privacy challenges in the internet of things, {eid: 84928029704}>, <None, {eid: 0003503018}>, <Sancus: Low-cost trustworthy extensible networked devices with a zero-software trusted computing base, {eid: 85076321179}>, <None, {eid: 84974543502}>, <Trusted language runtime (TLR): Enabling trusted applications on smartphones, {eid: 84860709376}>, <None, {eid: 84889063975}>, <Exploiting Trustzone on Android, {eid: 84964647584}>, <Protected software module architectures, {eid: 84928564346}>, <AppGuard: A hardware virtualization based approach on protecting user applications from untrusted commodity operating system, {eid: 84928034582}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,2017-09-14,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85041520995

In particular, when working with scientific software, such issues in the documentation pose a risk to producing reliable scientific results as they may cause improper or incorrect use of the software. R is a popular programming language for scientific software with a prolific package-based ecosystem, where users contribute packages (i.e., libraries). R packages are intended to be reused, and their users rely extensively on the available documentation. Thus, understanding what information developers provide in their packages’ documentation (generally, through a system known as Roxygen, based on Javadoc) is essential to contribute to it. This study mined 379 GitHub repositories of R packages and analysed a sample to develop a taxonomy of natural language descriptions used in Roxygen documentation. This was done through hybrid card sorting, which included two experienced R developers. The resulting taxonomy covers parameters, returns, and descriptions, providing a baseline for further studies. Our taxonomy is the first of its kind for R. Based on previous studies in pure object-oriented languages, our taxonomy could be extensible to other dynamically-typed languages used in scientific programming.","Documentation taxonomy, Package documentation, R Programming, Scientific software",,,,,,,,"<Software Documentation Issues Unveiled, {eid: 85072275739, doi: 10.1109/ICSE.2019.00122}>, <Software documentation: The practitioners’ perspective, {eid: 85094323088}>, <Water Science Software Institute: Agile and Open Source Scientific Software Development, {eid: 84903181880, doi: 10.1109/MCSE.2014.5}>, <Orchestrating single-cell analysis with bioconductor, {eid: 85076035714, doi: 10.1038/s41592-019-0654-x}>, <Identifying, categorizing and mitigating threats to validity in software engineering secondary studies, {eid: 85054761049}>, <A new family of software anti-patterns: Linguistic anti-patterns, {eid: 84877297166, doi: 10.1109/CSMR.2013.28}>, <Teaching r in the undergraduate ecology classroom: approaches, lessons learned, and recommendations, {eid: 85084461356, doi: 10.1002/ecs2.3060}>, <A machine-learning based ensemble method for anti-patterns detection, {eid: 85076559059, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2019.110486}>, <Evolution of communities of software: using tensor decompositions to compare software ecosystems, {eid: 85077073802, doi: 10.1007/s41109-019-0193-5}>, <Semantic-based analysis of javadoc comments, {eid: 85125472320}>, <On semantic detection of cloud api (anti)patterns, {eid: 85056226726, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2018.10.012}>, <Software system documentation: Coherent description of software system properties, {eid: 85142716093}>, <Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?, {eid: 85045879338, doi: 10.1080/00031305.2017.1399928}>, <Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, {eid: 85165229148}>, <None, {eid: 0007782774}>, <None, {eid: 63849329361, doi: 10.1007/978-0-387-75936-4}>, <Big Data Analysis with Interactive Visualization using R packages, {eid: 84985898270, doi: 10.1145/2640087.2644168}>, <An empirical study of identical function clones in CRAN, {eid: 84927921672, doi: 10.1109/IWSC.2015.7069885}>, <Technical Debt in the Peer-Review Documentation of R Packages: a rOpenSci Case Study, {eid: 85113671827}>, <Integrating data science and r programming at an early stage, {eid: 85050852170, doi: 10.1109/ISCMI.2017.8279587}>, <On the development and distribution of r packages: An empirical analysis of the r ecosystem, {eid: 84958576936, doi: 10.1145/2797433.2797476}>, <When github meets cran: An analysis of inter-repository package dependency problems, {eid: 84997434682, doi: 10.1109/SANER.2016.12}>, <Improving api documentation usability with knowledge pushing, {eid: 77949897678, doi: 10.1109/ICSE.2009.507053210.1109/ICSE.2009.5070532}>, <On using machine learning to identify knowledge in api reference documentation, {eid: 85071925748, doi: 10.1145/3338906.3338943}>, <The Evolution of the R Software Ecosystem, {eid: 84877268644, doi: 10.1109/CSMR.2013.33}>, <An interview study on sustainability concerns in software development projects, {eid: 85032583752, doi: 10.1109/SEAA.2017.70}>, <The promises of functional programming, {eid: 67651097443, doi: 10.1109/MCSE.2009.129}>, <Are there too many r packages?, {eid: 84898452772}>, <Understanding the scientific software ecosystem and its impact: Current and future measures, {eid: 84947607282, doi: 10.1093/reseval/rvv014}>, <Identifying self-admitted technical debt in open source projects using text mining, {eid: 85019111869, doi: 10.1007/s10664-017-9522-4}>, <None, {eid: 85057312415}>, <The promises and perils of mining github, {eid: 84914172716, doi: 10.1145/2597073.2597074}>, <Software documentation is not enough! requirements for the documentation of ai, {eid: 85117387607, doi: 10.1108/DPRG-03-2021-0047}>, <Modeling the Impact of R Packages Using Dependency and Contributor Networks, {eid: 85057311508, doi: 10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508255}>, <The democratization of data science education, {eid: 85074567757, doi: 10.1080/00031305.2019.1668849}>, <Challenges of measuring software impact through citations: An examination of the lme4 R package, {eid: 85062192546, doi: 10.1016/j.joi.2019.02.007}>, <) Is using deep learning frameworks free?

Blockchain technologies already enable the safe and fair exchange of digital assets in a decentralized manner; however, its application to information exchange remains largely unexplored. This article exposes our vision for a semantically-enriched blockchain software ecosystem named ONTOCHAIN, that enables the development of trustworthy distributed applications that can empower users, guarantee both their privacy and high quality of service, and ultimately support pluralism and democracy. ONTOCHAIN aims primarily to attain trustworthy service exchange and trustworthy content handling by means of advanced knowledge management mechanisms for several domains such as health, economy, public services, energy and sustainability, news, media, entertainment, Industry 4.0 and tourism. We present the main components of the ONTOCHAIN architecture and their functionality. Finally, the validity of our approach is exemplified by describing how decentralized applications can be enabled by the ONTOCHAIN ecosystem.","Anonymity, Decentralized apps, e-Commerce, Smart contract, Trust",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85121856385}>, <None, {eid: 85118141483}>, <None, {eid: 84872413071}>, <None, {eid: 85121851145}>, <Blockchain based service: a case study on IBM blockchain services and hyperledger fabric, {eid: 85121858325}>, <Blockchains and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, {eid: 84979828304}>, <Rep on the block: A next generation reputation system based on the blockchain, {eid: 84964507159}>, <Blockbench: A framework for analyzing private blockchains, {eid: 85021235588}>, <Blockchain for enterprise: Overview, opportunities and challenges, {eid: 85061142207}>, <Trust management in a blockchain based fog computing platform with trustless smart oracles, {eid: 85070732476}>, <Blockchain 3.0 applications survey, {eid: 85077736981}>, <Blockchain technology in healthcare: The revolution starts here, {eid: 85006489341}>, <Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system, {eid: 84881223453}>, <Performance analysis of hyperledger fabric platforms, {eid: 85054029585}>, <Towards anonymous, unlinkable, and confidential transactions in blockchain.

One drawback of today’s architectures is their strong integration into the onboard communication network based on predefined dependencies at design time. The idea is to reduce this rigid integration and technological dependencies. To this end, service-oriented architecture offers a suitable methodology since network communication is dynamically established at run-time. Aim: We target to provide a methodology for analysing hardware resources and synthesising automotive service-oriented architectures based on platform-independent service models. Subsequently, we focus on transforming these models into a platform-specific architecture realisation process following AUTOSAR Adaptive. Approach: For the platform-independent part, we apply the concepts of design space exploration and simulation to analyse and synthesise deployment configurations, i. e., mapping services to hardware resources at an early development stage. We refine these configurations to AUTOSAR Adaptive software architecture models representing the necessary input for a subsequent implementation process for the platform-specific part. Result: We present deployment configurations that are optimal for the usage of a given set of computing resources currently under consideration for our next generation of E/E architecture. We also provide simulation results that demonstrate the ability of these configurations to meet the run time requirements. Both results helped us to decide whether a particular configuration can be implemented. As a possible software toolchain for this purpose, we finally provide a prototype. Conclusion: The use of models and their analysis are proper means to get there, but the quality and speed of development must also be considered.","Automotive architectures, Model-based design, Real-time behaviour, Service-oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<Archeopterix: An extendable tool for architecture optimization of aadl models, {eid: 70349898605}>, <Software architecture optimization methods: A systematic literature review, {eid: 84877245642, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2012.64}>, <None, {eid: 85114373417}>, <A theory of timed automata, {eid: 0028413052, doi: 10.1016/0304-3975(94)90010-8}>, <Validity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities, {eid: 85060036181}>, <An optimization technique for vendor selection with quantity discounts using genetic algorithm, {eid: 84878626862}>, <None, {eid: 84873180354}>, <Cost models for electronic architecture trade studies, {eid: 0033680665}>, <Cost models with explicit uncertainties for electronic architecture trade-off and risk analysis, {eid: 84878809070}>, <The palladio component model for model-driven performance prediction, {eid: 55249125447, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2008.03.066}>, <UPPAAL - a tool suite for automatic verification of real-time systems, {eid: 84958037228}>, <Phan, A.D.: ν Z - Maximal Satisfaction with Z3, {eid: 84962624976}>, <Service-oriented modelling of automotive systems, {eid: 51949096167}>, <None, {eid: 84933475034}>, <Automotive architecture framework: Towards a holistic and standardised system architecture description, {eid: 77950427624}>, <A formal model of services, {eid: 33847685370, doi: 10.1145/1189748.1189753}>, <None, {eid: 0038688057, doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-0091-5}>, <Cross-layer behavioral modeling and simulation of e/e-architectures using preevision and ptolemy II, {eid: 85114285437, doi: 10.11128/sne.29.tn.10472}>, <Open Source AADL Tool, {eid: 85114334641}>, <On the nature of automotive service architectures, {eid: 85066469790}>, <None, {eid: 85114295171}>, <None, {eid: 84957056085}>, <Boosting re–use of embedded automotive applications through rich components, {eid: 70350050920}>, <None, {eid: 85114294539}>, <The mechatronicuml design method: Process and language for platform-independent modeling.

A level of trust is established based on that assumption. To verify and validate these assumptions, we propose a systematic procedure that starts at the design phase and spans the runtime of the systems. At design time, we propose system evaluation in pure virtual environments, allowing multiple system behaviors to be executed in a variety of scenarios. At runtime, we suggest performing predictive simulation to get insights into the system's decisionmaking process. This enables trust to be created in the system part of a cooperation. When cooperation is performed in open, uncertain environments, the negotiation protocols between collaborative systems must be monitored at runtime. By engaging in various negotiation protocols, the participants assign roles, schedule tasks, and combine their world views to allow more resilient perception and planning.

To assist developers in their maintenance tasks, many studies have proposed tools to analyze execution information from logs. However, it is as yet unknown how industry developers use logs in embedded software engineering. Objective: In this study, we aim to understand how developers use logs in an embedded software engineering context. Specifically, we would like to gain insights into the type of logs developers analyze, the purposes for which developers analyze logs, the information developers need from logs and their expectation on tool support. Method: In order to achieve the aim, we conducted these interview studies. First, we interviewed 25 software developers from ASML, which is a leading company in developing lithography machines. This exploratory case study provides the preliminary findings. Next, we validated and refined our findings by conducting a replication study. We involved 14 interviewees from four companies who have different software engineering roles in their daily work. Results: As the result of our first study, we compile a preliminary taxonomy which consists of four types of logs used by developers in practice, 18 purposes of using logs, 13 types of information developers search in logs, 13 challenges faced by developers in log analysis and three suggestions for tool support provided by developers. This taxonomy is refined in the replication study with three additional purposes, one additional information need, four additional challenges and three additional suggestions of tool support. In addition, with these two studies, we observed that text-based editors and self-made scripts are commonly used when it comes to tooling in log analysis practice. As indicated by the interviewees, the development of automatic analysis tools is hindered by the quality of the logs, which further suggests several challenges in log instrumentation and management. Conclusions: Based on our study, we provide suggestions for practitioners on logging practices. We provide implications for tool builders on how to further improve tools based on existing techniques. Finally, we suggest some research directions and studies for researchers to further study software logging.","Embedded software enigineering, Log analysis practice",,,,,,,,"<Detecting duplicate bug reports with software engineering domain knowledge, {eid: 84995582865, doi: 10.1002/smr.1821}>, <Using finite-state models for log differencing, {eid: 85058335840}>, <Embedded-software architects: it’s not only about the software, {eid: 84994408854, doi: 10.1109/MS.2016.142}>, <Visualization of concurrent program executions, {eid: 37349116566}>, <A survey on testing for cyber physical system, {eid: 84952786814}>, <Software traceability with topic modeling, {eid: 77954731555}>, <Sampling in software engineering research: A critical review and guidelines, {eid: 85148218442}>, <None, {eid: 85078894849}>, <The bones of the system: A case study of logging and telemetry at microsoft, {eid: 85026640950}>, <None, {eid: 85084931804}>, <Visualizing distributed system executions, {eid: 85084931804, doi: 10.1145/3375633}>, <On the synthesis of finite-state machines from samples of their behavior, {eid: 84938806379, doi: 10.1109/TC.1972.5009015}>, <None, {eid: 85132102320}>, <Asd case notes: Costs and benefits of applying formal methods to industrial control software, {eid: 26444604870}>, <Beyond checking: experiences of the validation interview, {eid: 79953279196, doi: 10.1177/1473325010370189}>, <A survey of software log instrumentation, {eid: 85109213599}>, <Characterizing logging practices in java-based open source software projects—a replication study in apache software foundation, {eid: 84966320690, doi: 10.1007/s10664-016-9429-5}>, <Automating co-evolution in model-driven engineering, {eid: 56649105329}>, <An empirical study of sysml in the modeling of embedded systems, {eid: 34548131296}>, <Generating test cases for specification mining, {eid: 77955911859}>, <An approach to feature location in distributed systems, {eid: 31044456271, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2004.12.018}>, <A systematic literature review on automated log abstraction techniques, {eid: 85079518720, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2020.106276}>, <Managing requirements in a co-evolution context, {eid: 27644506755}>, <Hierarchical abstraction of execution traces for program comprehension, {eid: 85051633907}>, <None, {eid: 84881127402}>, <None, {eid: 79952061987}>, <Change distilling: tree differencing for fine-grained source code change extraction, {eid: 35348968376}>, <None, {eid: 4344709196}>, <Where do developers log?

Their contributions span automation, digital twins, game characters with conscious-like behavior, and social media. However, there is still a lack of intelligent bots that can adapt to the variability and dynamic nature of digital web environments. Unlike human users, they have difficulty understanding and exploiting the affordances across multiple virtual environments. Despite the hype, bots with human user-like cognition do not currently exist. Chatbots, for instance, lack situational awareness on the digital platforms where they operate, preventing them from enacting meaningful and autonomous intelligent behavior similar to human users. In this survey, we aim to explore the role of cognitive architectures in supporting efforts towards engineering software bots with advanced general intelligence. We discuss how cognitive architectures can contribute to creating intelligent software bots. Furthermore, we highlight key architectural recommendations for the future development of autonomous, user-like cognitive bots.","cognitive architecture, cognitive automation, software bot",,,,,,,,"<A cognitive reliability model research for complex digital human-computer interface of industrial system, {eid: 85026764816}>, <Cognitive automation, {eid: 85123735905}>, <Smart agents in industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84977992593}>, <Industrial artificial intelligence for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 85053749537}>, <Industrial agents as a key enabler for realizing industrial cyber-physical systems: Multiagent systems entering industry 4.0, {eid: 85092370122}>, <Robotic process automation: Systematic literature review, {eid: 85072856412}>, <Current and future bots in software development, {eid: 85072918829}>, <The power of bots: Characterizing and understanding bots in OSS projects, {eid: 85072924359}>, <Explainable software bot contributions: Case study of automated bug fixes, {eid: 85072933116}>, <EveryBOTy counts: Examining human-machine teams in open source software development, {eid: 85129395504}>, <None, {eid: 85170390274}>, <Governance in digital open innovation platforms, {eid: 85179681542}>, <From the semantic web to social machines: A research challenge for AI on the world wide web, {eid: 73949141660}>, <Towards conscious-like behavior in computer game characters, {eid: 71549166985}>, <None, {eid: 85115860771}>, <Cognitive bots and algorithmic humans: Toward a shared understanding of social intelligence, {eid: 85065829659}>, <None, {eid: 85172377317}>, <None, {eid: 85138994795}>, <A literature review on the levels of automation during the years.

Variability mechanisms allows the adaptation of software to the needs of their users and the environment. However, VIS verification and validation (V&V) is challenging: the combinatorial explosion of the number of possible behaviours and undesired feature interactions are amongst such challenges. To tackle them, Featured Transitions Systems (FTS) were proposed a decade ago to model and verify the behaviours of VIS. In an FTS, each transition is annotated with a combination of features determining which variants can execute it. An FTS can model all possible behaviours of a given VIS. This compact model enabled us to create efficient V&V algorithms taking advantage of the behaviours shared amongst features resulting in a reduction of the V&V effort by several orders of magnitude. In this paper, we will cover the formalism, its applications and sketch promising research directions.","Model-checking, Modeling, Testing, Variability-intensive systems",,,,,,,,"<Similarity-based

Beyond traditional applications such as avionics, Attitude Orbit Control, and signal/telemetry processing, new developments increasingly leverage Machine Learning models to enhance the autonomy of spacecraft. Such AI-based functional-ities promise significant advantages, but require computing power beyond what can be provided by current on-board platforms. At the same time, the challenge of technological sovereignty requires a move towards open hardware and software. To achieve these objectives, within the KDT ISOLDE project started in 2023, we propose the development of a new family of processors for AI-based applications to be deployed on board of satellites. In this paper, we showcase some examples of space applications with their requirements, and highlight the possible solutions as well as the corresponding work that will be carried out in ISOLDE, and the expected results.","High Performance Computing, Power Modeling and Control, RISC-V, Space Applications",,,,,,,,"<Towards extreme scale technologies and accelerators for eurohpc hw/sw supercomputing applications for exascale: The textarossa approach, {eid: 85139308705}>, <Dory: Automatic end-to-end deployment of real-world DNNs on low-cost IoT MCUs, {eid: 85103250570}>, <Poster abstract: Run-time dynamic WCET estimation, {eid: 85159659081}>, <None, {eid: 85100525506}>, <None, {eid: 85097413699}>, <Very low latency architecture for earth observation satellite onboard data handling, compression, and encryption, {eid: 85127424260}>, <Hardware and software optimizations for accelerating deep neural networks: Survey of current trends, challenges, and the road ahead, {eid: 85097150096}>, <Ara: A 1-GHz+ scalable and energy-efficient RISC-V vector processor with multiprecision floating-point support in 22-nm FD-SOI, {eid: 85078543968}>, <Sok: Understanding the prevailing security vulnerabilities in trustzone-assisted TEE systems, {eid: 85091127949}>, <Dynamic precision autotuning with TAFFO, {eid: 85088323404}>, <None, {eid: 85187693024}>, <Unified turbo/LDPC code decoder architecture for deep-space communications, {eid: 84919663375}>, <Automatic identification and hardware implementation of a resource-constrained power model for embedded systems, {eid: 85096179369}>, <Spike encoding techniques for IoT time-varying signals benchmarked on a neuromorphic classification task, {eid: 85145503558}>, <Configuring an embedded neuromorphic coprocessor using a risc-v chip for enabling edge computing applications, {eid: 85126724920}>, <FPGA implementation of bike for quantum-resistant TLS, {eid: 85145266086}>, <Efficient and scalable FPGA design of GF(2m) inversion for post-quantum cryptosystems, {eid: 85124727972}>, <DARKSIDE: A heterogeneous RISC-V compute cluster for extreme-edge on-chip DNN inference and training, {eid: 85148763913}>, <Trusted execution environments: Properties, applications, and challenges, {eid: 85082399930}>, <Cyber-physical challenges for space systems, {eid: 84861514859}>, <Efficient hardware implementation of the LEDAcrypt decoder, {eid: 85105078069}>, <Implications of reduced-precision computations in HPC: Performance, energy and error.

However, existing work indicates that few modelling frameworks explicitly include requirements engineering (RE), and that natural language descriptions are still the status quo in RE. Therefore, we aim to increase the understanding of current and potential future use of models in RE, with respect to the automotive domain. In this paper, we report our findings from a multiple-case study with two automotive companies, collecting interview data from 14 practitioners. Our results show that models are used for a variety of different purposes during RE in the automotive domain, e.g. to improve communication and to handle complexity. However, these models are often used in an unsystematic fashion and restricted to few experts. A more widespread use of models is prevented by various challenges, most of which align with existing work on model use in a general sense. Furthermore, our results indicate that there are many potential benefits associated with future use of models during RE. Interestingly, existing research does not align well with several of the proposed use cases, e.g. restricting the use of models to informal notations for communication purposes. Based on our findings, we recommend a stronger focus on informal modelling and on using models for multi-disciplinary environments. Additionally, we see the need for future work in the area of model use, i.e. information extraction from models by non-expert modellers.","Automotive, Case study, Empirical research, MBE, MDE, Modelling, Requirements engineering",,,,,,,,"<A brazilian survey on UML and model-driven practices for embedded software development, {eid: 84875253410, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2012.11.023}>, <Aligning qualitative, real-time, and probabilistic property specification patterns using a structured english grammar, {eid: 84937702668, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2015.2398877}>, <None, {eid: 84870717298, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-21001-3}>, <Model-driven engineering in a large industrial context—motorola case study, {eid: 33646192696}>, <Alignment of requirements specification and testing: a systematic mapping study, {eid: 80051659665}>, <The use of a requirements modeling language for industrial applications, {eid: 84870679045}>, <Bridging the gap between systems and software engineering by using the spes modeling framework as a general systems engineering philosophy, {eid: 84897974286, doi: 10.1016/j.procs.2014.03.024}>, <A formal systems engineering approach in practice: an experience report, {eid: 84907904047}>, <Early validation of automation plant control software using simulation based on assumption modeling and validation use cases, {eid: 84964623320}>, <Guiding requirements engineering for software-intensive embedded systems in the automotive industry, {eid: 84895060248, doi: 10.1007/s00450-010-0136-y}>, <Applying the spes modeling framework, {eid: 85068943660}>, <Challenges in automotive software engineering, {eid: 34247127701}>, <None, {eid: 0141988044}>, <A controlled natural language approach for integrating requirements and model-driven engineering, {eid: 70749135971}>, <Patterns in property specifications for finite-state verification, {eid: 0032667112}>, <The need of complementing plan-driven requirements engineering with emerging communication: Experiences from volvo car group, {eid: 84962377317}>, <A requirements engineering methodology combining models and controlled natural language, {eid: 84908636914}>, <Problems and opportunities for model-centric versus code-centric software development: A survey of software professionals, {eid: 79959222837}>, <Reasoning about inconsistencies in natural language requirements, {eid: 33745172461, doi: 10.1145/1072997.1072999}>, <Problems and deficiencies of uml as a requirements specification language, {eid: 77953747042}>, <On the use of software design models in software development practice: an empirical investigation, {eid: 84905864992, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2014.03.082}>, <Improving the state of automotive software engineering, {eid: 85030648225, doi: 10.1109/MS.2017.3571571}>, <Scenario-based architecting with architecture trace diagrams, {eid: 84954495958}>, <Experiences in managing an automotive requirements engineering process, {eid: 17044392684}>, <Analyzing requirements engineering processes: A case study, {eid: 0141693419}>, <Model-driven engineering practices in industry, {eid: 79959907898}>, <Model-driven engineering practices in industry: social, organizational and managerial factors that lead to success or failure, {eid: 84900499307, doi: 10.1016/j.scico.2013.03.017}>, <Empirical assessment of mde in industry, {eid: 79959917914}>, <Evaluating costs and benefits of model-based development of embedded software systems in the car industry–results of a qualitative case study, {eid: 84872344192}>, <Assessing the state-of-practice of model-based engineering in the embedded systems domain, {eid: 84921415602}>, <Model-based engineering in the embedded systems domain: an industrial survey on the state-of-practice, {eid: 84962207101, doi: 10.1007/s10270-016-0523-3}>, <Organisation and communication problems in automotive requirements engineering, {eid: 84994509953, doi: 10.1007/s00766-016-0261-7}>, <A systematic review of the use of requirements engineering techniques in model-driven development, {eid: 78349274448}>, <Combining xtext and oslc for integrated model-based requirements engineering, {eid: 84958237425}>, <Qualitative content analysis-research instrument or mode of interpretation, {eid: 33744790490}>, <A case study on the application of an artefact-based requirements engineering approach, {eid: 82955219748}>, <A meta model for artefact-orientation: Fundamentals and lessons learned in requirements engineering, {eid: 78349271315}>, <Field study on requirements engineering: Investigation of artefacts, project parameters, and execution strategies, {eid: 81055157752, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2011.09.001}>, <Improving requirements engineering by artefact orientation, {eid: 84884937114}>, <Where is the proof?—A review of experiences from applying mde in industry, {eid: 70349858084}>, <Where does model-driven engineering help?

For critical safety systems, the significance of data quality is even higher since incorrect or low-quality data may cause fatal faults. However, there are challenges in identifying and managing data quality. In particular, there is no accepted process to define and continuously test data quality concerning what is necessary for operating the system. This lack is problematic because even safety-critical systems become increasingly dependent on data. Here, we propose a Candidate Framework for Data Quality Assessment and Maintenance (CaFDaQAM) to systematically manage data quality and related requirements based on design science research. The framework is constructed based on an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) case study. The study is based on empirical data from a literature review, focus groups, and design workshops. The proposed framework consists of four components: a Data Quality Workflow, a List of Data Quality Challenges, a List of Data Quality Attributes, and Solution Candidates. Together, the components act as tools for data quality assessment and maintenance.

Lenguajes y Sistemas Informáticos, University of Seville>",,"© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.Feature models have been used since the 90s to describe software product lines as a way of reusing common parts in a family of software systems. In 2010, a systematic literature review was published summarizing the advances and settling the basis of the area of automated analysis of feature models (AAFM). From then on, different studies have applied the AAFM in different domains. In this paper, we provide an overview of the evolution of this field since 2010 by performing a systematic mapping study considering 423 primary sources. We found six different variability facets where the AAFM is being applied that define the tendencies: product configuration and derivation; testing and evolution; reverse engineering; multi-model variability-analysis; variability modelling and variability-intensive systems. We also confirmed that there is a lack of industrial evidence in most of the cases. Finally, we present where and when the papers have been published and who are the authors and institutions that are contributing to the field. We observed that the maturity is proven by the increment in the number of journals published along the years as well as the diversity of conferences and workshops where papers are published. We also suggest some synergies with other areas such as cloud or mobile computing among others that can motivate further research in the future.","Automated analysis, Feature models, Software product

For computer science, several threats to the completeness of such reviews have been identified, leading to recommendations and guidelines on how to improve their quality. However, few studies address to what extent researchers can replicate an SLR. To conduct a replication, researchers have to first understand how the set of primary studies has been identified in the original study, and can ideally retrieve the same set when following the reported protocol. In this article, we focus on this initial step of a replication and report a two-fold empirical study: Initially, we performed a tertiary study using a sample of SLRs in computer science and identified what information that is needed to replicate the searches is reported. Based on the results, we conducted a descriptive, multi-case study on digital libraries to investigate to what extent these allow replications. The results reveal two threats to replications of SLRs: First, while researchers have improved the quality of their reports, relevant details are still missing—we refer to a reporting threat. Second, we found that some digital libraries are inconsistent in their query results—we refer to a searching threat. While researchers conducting a review can only overcome the first threat and the second may not be an issue for all kinds of replications, researchers should be aware of both threats when conducting, reviewing, and building on SLRs.","Digital library, Replication, Software engineering, Systematic literature review, Tertiary study, Threats to validity",,,,,,,,"<A comparative evaluation of cloud migration optimization approaches: a systematic literature review, {eid: 84943170691}>, <Software test process improvement approaches: a systematic literature review and an industrial case study, {eid: 84949796965, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2015.08.048}>, <Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering: Preliminary Results from Interviews with Researchers, {eid: 72449188610}>, <Experiences from Using Snowballing and Database Searches in Systematic Literature Studies, {eid: 84961128932}>, <Search Engine Overlaps: Do They Agree or Disagree?, {eid: 36949014991}>, <A systematic Tool-Supported method for conducting literature reviews in information systems, {eid: 84870627947}>, <None, {eid: 42149158539}>, <Debating Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) and their Ramifications for IS: A Rejoinder to Mike Chiasson, Briony Oates, Ulrike Schultze, and Richard Watson, {eid: 84930034484, doi: 10.1057/jit.2015.15}>, <None, {eid: 84885356809}>, <Lessons from applying the systematic literature review process within the software engineering domain, {eid: 33847286844, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2006.07.009}>, <Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, {eid: 34247123714}>, <Reporting systematic reviews: Some lessons from a tertiary study, {eid: 85032943825, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2017.10.017}>, <The contribution that empirical studies performed in industry make to the findings of systematic reviews: A tertiary study, {eid: 85032219860, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2017.10.012}>, <Towards reporting guidelines for experimental replications: A proposal, {eid: 84877293370}>, <Balancing the strengths of systematic and narrative reviews, {eid: 15944422498, doi: 10.1093/humupd/dmh058}>, <Six years of systematic literature reviews in software engineering: an updated tertiary study, {eid: 79958214321, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2011.04.004}>, <None, {eid: 84944037468, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-07374-3}>, <Strength of Evidence in Systematic Reviews in Software Engineering, {eid: 62949200408}>, <Evidence-Based Software engineering for practitioners, {eid: 19144370101, doi: 10.1109/MS.2005.6}>, <Applying Systematic Reviews to Diverse Study Types: An Experience Report, {eid: 45449103227}>, <Comparison of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar: Strengths and Weaknesses, {eid: 38949137710, doi: 10.1096/fj.07-9492LSF}>, <Using Forward Snowballing to Update Systematic Reviews in Software Engineering, {eid: 84991596539}>, <Evaluation of Digital Libraries, {eid: 35548933739, doi: 10.1007/s00799-007-0011-z}>, <None, {eid: 49349088581, doi: 10.4324/9781315266091}>, <The Future of CiteSeer: CiteSeerx, {eid: 33750285530, doi: 10.1007/11871637_2}>, <Understanding replication of experiments in software engineering: a classification, {eid: 84900002129, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2014.04.004}>, <Microsoft Academic: Is the Phoenix Getting Wings?, {eid: 84996848335, doi: 10.1007/s11192-016-2185-x}>, <Identification of SLR tool needs – results of a community workshop, {eid: 84949466464, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2015.10.011}>, <Software integration in global software development: Success factors for GSD vendors, {eid: 84947081217}>, <A Tertiary Study: Experiences of Conducting Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, {eid: 84877258226}>, <Systematic Literature Studies: Database Searches vs. Backward Snowballing, {eid: 84867499427}>, <Five steps to conducting a systematic review, {eid: 0037349859, doi: 10.1177/014107680309600304}>, <A systematic review of systematic review process research in software engineering, {eid: 84885174213, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2013.07.010}>, <None, {eid: 44649122227}>, <Systematic literature reviews in software engineering -

In this context, identifying data security requirements and detecting potential privacy violations are crucial. In the area of model-based security requirements analysis, numerous research efforts have been done. However, few existing studies support automatic privacy violation identification from software requirements. To fill this gap, this paper presents MBIPV, a Model-Based approach for Identifying Privacy Violations from software requirements. First, this paper identifies six types of privacy violations in software requirements. Second, the MBIPV profile is proposed to support modeling software requirements using UML. Third, the MBIPV prototype tool is developed to generate formal models and corresponding privacy properties automatically. Then, the privacy properties are automatically verified by model checking. We evaluated the MBIPV method through case studies of four representative software systems from different domains: smart health, smart transportation, smart home, and e-commerce. The results show that MBIPV has high accuracy and efficiency in identifying the privacy violations from the software requirements. To the best of our knowledge, MBIPV is the first model-based approach that supports the automatic verification of privacy properties of UML software requirement models. The source code of the MBIPV tool and the experimental data are available online at https://github.com/YETONG1219/MBIPV.","Formal modeling, Formal verification, Privacy violation, Software requirement modeling, UML",,,,,,,,"<Method and framework for security risks analysis guided by safety criteria, {eid: 85096799845}>, <Identifying privacy weaknesses from multi-party trigger-action integration platforms, {eid: 85111416741}>, <A model-based approach to realize privacy and data protection by design.

One of the most popular behavioral modeling techniques is the state machine. Many state machine modeling guidelines recommend that a state machine should have more than one state in order to be meaningful. However, single-state state machines (SSSMs) violating this recommendation have been used in modeling cases reported in the literature. Objective: We aim for understanding the phenomenon of using SSSMs in practice as understanding why developers violate the modeling guidelines is the first step towards improvement of modeling tools and practice. Method: To study the phenomenon, we conducted an exploratory study which consists of two complementary studies. The first study investigated the prevalence and role of SSSMs in the domain of embedded systems, as well as the reasons why developers use them and their perceived advantages and disadvantages. We employed the sequential explanatory strategy, including repository mining and interview, to study 1500 state machines from 26 components at ASML, a leading company in manufacturing lithography machines from the semiconductor industry. In the second study, we investigated the evolutionary aspects of SSSMs, exploring when SSSMs are introduced to the systems and how developers modify them by mining the largest state-machine-based component from the company. Results: We observe that 25 out of 26 components contain SSSMs. Our interviews suggest that SSSMs are used to interface with the existing code, to deal with tool limitations, to facilitate maintenance and to ease verification. Our study on the evolutionary aspects of SSSMs reveals that the need for SSSMs to deal with tool limitations grew continuously over the years. Moreover, only a minority of SSSMs have been changed between SSSM and multiple-state state machine (MSSM) during their evolution. The most frequent modifications developers made to SSSMs is inserting events with constraints on the execution of the events. Conclusions: Based on our results, we provide implications for developers and tool builders. Furthermore, we formulate hypotheses about the effectiveness of SSSMs, the impacts of SSSMs on development, maintenance and verification as well as the evolution of SSSMs.","Model-driven engineering, modeling practice, Single-state state machines",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84924578268}>, <An empirical investigation on the reusability of design patterns and software packages, {eid: 80053563848, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2011.06.047}>, <The effect of gof design patterns on stability: a case study, {eid: 84939556792, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2015.2414917}>, <Design pattern recovery in object-oriented software, {eid: 0031632389}>, <Interface protocol inference to aid understanding legacy software components, {eid: 85063091119}>, <Clone detection for ecore metamodels using n-grams, {eid: 85052020422}>, <A survey of symbolic execution techniques, {eid: 85049585791, doi: 10.1145/3182657}>, <Swig: An easy to use tool for integrating scripting languages with c and c++, {eid: 34547418487}>, <None, {eid: 85114735363}>, <The promises and perils of mining git.

This study contributes an in-depth empirical study of whether and how mocking frameworks are used in Apache projects. The key findings and insights of this study include: First, mocking frameworks are widely used in 66% of Apache Java projects, with Mockito, EasyMock, and PowerMock being the top three most popular frameworks. Larger-scale and more recent projects tend to observe a stronger need to use mocking frameworks. This underscores the importance of mocking in practice and related future research. Second, mocking is overall practiced quite selectively in software projects—not all test files use mocking, nor all dependencies of a test target are mocked. It calls for more future research to gain a more systematic understanding of when and what to mock to provide formal guidance to practitioners. On top of this, the intensity of mocking in different projects shows different trends in the projects’ evolution history—implying the compound effects of various factors, such as the pace of a project’s growth, the available resources, time pressure, and priority, etc. This points to an important future research direction in facilitating best mocking practices in software evolution. Furthermore, we revealed the most frequently used APIs in the three most popular frameworks, organized based on the function types. The top five APIs in each functional type of the three mocking frameworks usually take the majority (78% to 100%) of usage in Apache projects. This indicates that developers can focus on these APIs to quickly learn the common usage of these mocking frameworks. We further investigated informal methods of mocking, which do not rely on any mocking framework. These informal mocking methods point to potential sub-optimal mocking practices that could be improved, as well as limitations of existing mocking frameworks. Finally, we conducted a developer survey to collect additional insights regarding the above analysis based on their experience, which complements our analysis based on repository mining. Overall, this study offers practitioners profound empirical knowledge of how mocking frameworks are used in practice and sheds light on future research directions to enhancing mocking in practice.","Apache open-source projects, Mocking frameworks, Software testing",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84894521084}>, <None, {eid: 85182804687}>, <Private api access and functional mocking in automated unit test generation, {eid: 85020738973}>, <Web content management: Systems, features, and best practices. “, {eid: 85112306993}>, <Software testing research: Achievements, challenges, dreams.

One of these challenges is the implementation of requirements reuse approaches. Although several theoretical proposals exist, little is known about the practices that are currently adopted in industry. Our goal is to contribute to the investigation of the state of the practice in the reuse of requirements, eliciting current practices from practitioners, and their opinions whenever appropriate. Besides reuse in general, we focus on requirement patterns as a particular strategy to reuse. We conducted an exploratory survey based on an online questionnaire. We received 71 responses from requirements engineers with industrial experience in the field, which were analyzed in order to derive observations. Although we found that a high majority of respondents declared some level of reuse in their projects (in particular, non-functional requirements were identified as the most similar and recurrent among projects), it is true that only a minority of them declared such reuse as a regular practice. Larger IT organizations and IT organizations with well-established software processes and methods present higher levels of reuse. Ignorance of reuse techniques and processes is the main reason preventing wider adoption. From the different existing reuse techniques, the simplest ones based on textual copy and subsequent tailoring of former requirements are the most adopted techniques. However, participants who apply reuse more often tend to use more elaborate techniques. Opinions of respondents about the use of requirement patterns show that they can be expected to mitigate problems related to the quality of the resulting requirements, such as lack of uniformity, inconsistency, or ambiguity. The main reasons behind the lack of adoption of requirement patterns by practitioners (in spite of the increasing research approaches proposed in the community) are related to the lack of a well-defined reuse method and involvement of requirement engineers. The results of our paper are interesting for practitioners since we highlight relevant observations from the survey participants’ experiences when deciding to implement requirements reuse practices. We also suggest future lines of research based on the needs pointed out in the results.","Empirical studies, Online questionnaire, Requirement patterns, Requirements engineering, Requirements reuse, Surveys",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 79960567300}>, <Exploring software practitioners perceptions and experience in requirements reuse an empirical study in Malaysia, {eid: 84930799224}>, <Software process improvement problems in twelve software companies: an empirical analysis, {eid: 0037366147, doi: 10.1023/A:1021764731148}>, <Software defect reduction top 10 list, {eid: 85008047921, doi: 10.1109/2.962984}>, <Analyzing Likert data, {eid: 84861729265}>, <Design & use of software architectures, {eid: 40649085413}>, <Why do projects fail. 101 Common Causes, {eid: 85029942807}>, <None, {eid: 84886428068}>, <Quer C (2006) Managing Non-technical requirements in COTS components selection, {eid: 41149095241}>, <Perspectives on refactoring planning and practice: an empirical study, {eid: 84933575499}>, <Mei H (2005) An Approach to constructing feature models based on requirements clustering, {eid: 27644584984}>, <None, {eid: 84864838979}>, <Supakkul S (2006) Capturing and reusing functional and non-functional requirements knowledge: a goal-object pattern approach, {eid: 34547406649}>, <Empirical study of Sommerville and Sawyer’s requirements engineering practices, {eid: 70349751762, doi: 10.1049/iet-sen.2008.0076}>, <Stalhane T (2012) Pattern-based Security requirements specification using ontologies and boilerplates, {eid: 84871603509}>, <Investigating probabilistic sampling approaches for large-scale surveys in software engineering, {eid: 85006702460, doi: 10.1186/s40411-015-0023-0}>, <What Java developers know about compatibility, and why this matters, {eid: 84966415665, doi: 10.1007/s10664-015-9389-1}>, <Internet, phone, mail, and mixed-mode surveys: the tailored design method, {eid: 84991439665}>, <The demographics of social media users, {eid: 85029949966}>, <Factors of software process improvement success in small and large organizations: an empirical study in the scandinavian context, {eid: 1542376942, doi: 10.1145/949952.940092}>, <An empirical investigation of the key factors for success in software process improvement, {eid: 22944488868, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2005.53}>, <Managing requirements specifications for product lines–An approach and industry case study, {eid: 61349133483, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2008.07.046}>, <The value of online surveys, {eid: 17744388560, doi: 10.1108/10662240510590360}>, <Rodriguez-Navas G (2014) Reassessing the pattern-based approach for formalizing requirements in the automotive domain, {eid: 84909947301}>, <Constructing and using software requirement patterns, {eid: 84886428068, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-34419-05}>, <None, {eid: 84886400676}>, <Software Project Failure Costs Billions-Better Estimation & Planning Can Help.

However, developing such business models is a continuous challenging activity where different tasks need to be performed, and business decisions need to be made. Both have to fit the constantly changeable situation in which the business model is developed to reduce the risk of developing ineffective business models with low market penetration. Therefore, a method for developing situation-specific business models is needed. As a solution, we refine the concept of situational method engineering (SME) to business model development. SME, in turn, provides means to construct situation-specific development methods out of fragments from a method repository. We develop a concept for the continuous situation-specific development of business models based on design science. The approach uses the roles of a domain expert, a method engineer, and a business developer together with a repository with method fragments for developing business models and a repository with modeling artifacts for supporting the development. Both repositories are filled by utilizing the experience of domain experts. Out of these repositories, situation-specific development methods for developing business models can be continuously composed based on the changeable situation by the method engineer and enacted by the business developer. We implement it as an open-source tool and evaluate its applicability in an industrial case study of developing a business model for a local event platform. Our results show that situation awareness supports the continuous development of business models.","Business model canvas, Business model development, Continuous development, Situation-specific, Situational method engineering",,,,,,,,"<A multi-concern method for identifying business services: A situational method engineering study, {eid: 85086312141}>, <Taxonomy of grid business models, {eid: 38049041472}>, <Forming and exploiting opportunities: the implications of discovery and creation processes for entrepreneurial and organizational research, {eid: 84873279035, doi: 10.1287/orsc.1110.0727}>, <Simultaneous experimentation as a learning strategy: business model development under uncertainty, {eid: 84889676215, doi: 10.1002/sej.1170}>, <None, {eid: 84881286743, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-37521-7}>, <How do business model tools facilitate business model exploration?

Digital Ecosystems represent the union between the digital world and real world. Cyber-Physical Systems provide a unified framework for connecting the abstract computational artifacts with the physical world. This allows for robust and flexible architectural design with multi-scale dynamics and integrated wired and wireless networking for managing the flows of mass, energy, and information in a coherent way. An example of Cyber Physical Systems is connecting sensors (which provide information from the physical world) to the internet (which represents the cyber world). Cyber-Physical Systems has recently been listed as the No.1 research priority by the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Cyber-Physical Systems framework has the capability to tackle numerous scientific, social and economical issues. However, building Cyber-Physical Systems is not a trivial task. It requires a new ground-breaking theory that models cyber and physical resources in a unified framework. Digital Ecosystems constitute a superset which includes these Cyber Physical systems. Thus the underlying theories of Digital Ecosystems will help to provide important pointers to the development of these Cyber Physical Systems. None of the current state-of-the-art methods are able to overcome the challenges of building such Cyber Physical Systems due to the fact that computer science and theories underlying the real world have developed independently based on overly-simplified assumptions of each other. For example, many key requirements (e.g. uncertainty, inaccuracy, etc.) crucial to physical systems are not captured and fully dealt within the computer science research agenda. Similarly computational complexity, system evolution, software failure and failures of computer hardware are often ignored from the viewpoint of theories of the physical world, which treats computation as a precise, error-free, static `black-box'. The solution to Cyber-Physical Systems must break the boundary between the cyber world and the physical world by providing a unified infrastructure that permits integrated models addressing issues from both worlds simultaneously. Therefore, in this keynote, we explore an approach to such an infrastructure using the framework of Digital Ecosystems.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,

of interoperability limiting the development of systems capable of
working collaboratively from the point of view of machines and software.
Additionally, environmental issues related to manufacturing systems have
emerged during the last decades, related to sustainability problems
faced in the world. Thus, the proposed work aims to present an
interoperable solution based on events to reduce the complexity of
integration, while creating energetic profiles for the machines to allow
the optimization of their energy consumption. A publish/subscribe-based
architecture is proposed, where the instantiation is based on Apache
Kafka. The proposed solution was implemented in two robotic cells in the
automotive industry, constituted by different hardware, which allowed
testing the integration of different components. The energy consumption
data was then sent to a Postgres database where a graphical interface
allowed the operator to monitor the performance of each cell regarding
energy consumption. The results are promising due to the system's
ability to integrate tools from different vendors and different
technologies. Furthermore, it allows the possibility to use these
developments to deliver more sustainable systems using more advanced
solutions, such as production scheduling, to reduce energy consumption.","apache kafka, cyber-physical production systems, energy efficiency, industry 4, 0, interoperability, smart manufacturing, sustainability",,,,,,,,None,,,MDPI,,,None,,,,,,,English,,,,,,

Focusing on DT innovation pathways for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a DT innovation roadmap incorporating various notions of ecosystems can thus be developed based on the findings in response to advancements in the “Helix” models of innovation and policy progress in green digital transformation. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, a bibliographic search was conducted in the Web of Science (WoS) database. A bibliometric analysis was then performed, leading to various science mapping outcomes. The research findings suggest practical DT innovation pathways for stakeholders aiming to achieve SDGs and a DT innovation roadmap to assist researchers in navigating the evolving innovation landscape. Since 2007, research output has experienced rapid growth, especially after 2018, with active contributions from countries such as China, Australia, England, and Italy, as well as affiliations such as Guangzhou Nanfang College, Curtin University, and Harvard University. The findings, including a performance overview, a set of clustering analyses of concepts and themes, the conceptual and intellectual structure, and an SDG identification table, provide the basis for the proposed Green Digital Transformation (GDT) innovation roadmap with DT innovation pathways. This research is the first to conduct a bibliometric analysis and science mapping of the DT literature focusing on innovation and business ecosystems. The proposed GDT innovation roadmap outlines the usefulness of the concept of “ecosystem innovation,” integrating the natural ecosystem, ecosystem services, ecosystem economy, business ecosystem, innovation ecosystem, and digital ecosystems, thereby calling for the eco-design of DT strategies that foster alignment and partnership across sectors and disciplines.","digital platforms, digital ecosystem, digitalization, innovation ecosystems, open innovation, business model, ecosystem economy, industry 4.0, carbon neutrality, socio-technical transition",,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,,,,,,,
