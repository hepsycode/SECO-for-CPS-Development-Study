These systems are considered high-assurance since errors during execution could result in injury, loss of life, environmental impact, and/or financial loss. In order to facilitate the development and verification of dynamically adaptive systems, we separate functional concerns from adaptive concerns. Specifically, we model a dynamically adaptive program as a collection of (non-adaptive) steady-state programs and a set of adaptations that realize transitions among steady state programs in response to environmental changes. We use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to specify properties of the non-adaptive portions of the system, and we use A-LTL (an adapt-operator extension to LTL) to concisely specify properties that hold during the adaptation process. Model checking offers an attractive approach to automatically analyzing models for adherence to formal properties and thus providing assurance. However, currently, model checkers are unable to verify properties specified using A-LTL. Moreover, as the number of steady-state programs and adaptations increase, the verification costs (in terms of space and time) potentially become unwieldy. To address these issues, we propose a modular model checking approach to verifying that a formal model of an adaptive program satisfies its requirements specified in LTL and A-LTL, respectively.

In 2010, a systematic literature review was published summarizing the advances and settling the basis of the area of automated analysis of feature models (AAFM). From then on, different studies have applied the AAFM in different domains. In this paper, we provide an overview of the evolution of this field since 2010 by performing a systematic mapping study considering 423 primary sources. We found six different variability facets where the AAFM is being applied that define the tendencies: product configuration and derivation; testing and evolution; reverse engineering; multi-model variability-analysis; variability modelling and variability-intensive systems. We also confirmed that there is a lack of industrial evidence in most of the cases. Finally, we present where and when the papers have been published and who are the authors and institutions that are contributing to the field. We observed that the maturity is proven by the increment in the number of journals published along the years as well as the diversity of conferences and workshops where papers are published. We also suggest some synergies with other areas such as cloud or mobile computing among others that can motivate further research in the future.","Automated analysis, Feature models, Software product lines, Variability-intensive systems",2019-05-14,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

In general, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things are the sensing and communication infrastructures for CPS. Currently, software-defined networking (SDN) have been used as the new networking architecture for typical WSNs and CPS. However, there are two unresolved problems for a software-defined CPS. First, a feasible systemic architecture is a must for software-defined CPS, which should provide a global virtualization management and closed-loop control between the cyber side and the physical side in a CPS. Second, the lifetime of a software-defined CPS scenario needs to be extended for critical applications. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a systematic virtual networking architecture to perform the global virtualization control and monitoring of a CPS, in which network functions virtualization (NFV) configuration and orchestration can be realized. Moreover, based on the proposed architecture, a novel lifetime extension scheme (NLES), is proposed for a software-defined CPS. To orchestrate the resource dynamically and efficiently, the instant programmability of an SDN and instant deployment capability of NFV are utilized to control the topology of node modes of a CPS. Then, a game theoretic topology decision approach is proposed to control the topology of the clustering and virtual network function deployment of sensors at run-time in a CPS. The experimental results show that NLES has longer lifetime compared to those of the traditional schemes.","Cyber-physical systems (CPSs), game theory, lifetime extension, network function virtualization (NFV), software-defined networking (SDN)",2019-04-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

Over the last few decades, the importance of software engineering in the automotive industry has increased significantly and has attracted much attention from both scholars and practitioners. A large body-of-knowledge on automotive software engineering has accumulated in several scientific publications, yet there is no systematic analysis of that knowledge. This systematic mapping study aims to classify and analyze the literature related to automotive software engineering in order to provide a structured body-of-knowledge, identify well-established topics and potential research gaps. The review includes 679 articles from multiple research sub-area, published between 1990 and 2015. The primary studies were analyzed and classified with respect to five different dimensions. Furthermore, potential research gaps and recommendations for future research are presented. Three areas, namely system/software architecture and design, qualification testing, and reuse were the most frequently addressed topics in the literature. There were fewer comparative and validation studies, and the literature lacks practitioner-oriented guidelines. Overall, research activity on automotive software engineering seems to have high industrial relevance but is relatively lower in its scientific rigor.","Automotive software engineering, Automotive systems, Embedded systems, Literature survey, Software-intensive systems, Systematic mapping study",2017-06-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

Smart places (cities, districts, neighbourhoods, ecosystems) depend on the way digitalisation disrupts systems of innovation in cities, making it more open, global, participatory and experimental. We argue that the rise and interconnection of various types of intelligence (artificial, human, collective) could bring profound changes in the way smart places are being created and evolve. In this context, cyber-physical systems of innovation are deployed through multiple nodes acquiring digital companions, collaboration is deployed over physical, social, and digital spaces, and actors can use complex methods guided by software and get insights from data and analytics. The paper also presents the case study of OnlineS3, a two-year Horizon 2020 project, which developed and tested a digital platform composed of applications, datasets and roadmaps, which altogether create a digital environment for empowering the design of smart specialisation strategies for local and regional systems of innovation. The results indicate that digital transformation allows the operationalisation of multiple methodologies which have not been used earlier by policy makers, due to lack of capabilities. It can also increase the scalability of indicators facilitating decision making at different spatial scales and, therefore, better respond to the complexity of innovation systems providing dynamic and scale-diverse information.","Co-creation, Data-intelligence, Digital platforms, Digitalisation, Intelligent cities, Smart cities, Systems of innovation",2021-12-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

However, it is not clear what the implications are on software quality when moving from a traditional approach to an ecosystem, and this is becoming increasingly important as ecosystems emerge in critical domains such as embedded applications. Therefore, this paper investigates the challenges related to quality assurance in software ecosystems, and identifies what approaches have been proposed in the literature. The research method used is a systematic literature mapping, which however only resulted in a small set of six papers. The literature findings are complemented with a constructive approach where areas are identified that merit further research, resulting in a set of research topics that form a research agenda for quality assurance in software ecosystems. The agenda spans the entire system life-cycle, and focuses on challenges particular to an ecosystem setting, which are mainly the results of the interactions across organizational borders, and the dynamic system integration being controlled by the users.","Quality, Software ecosystems, Testing, Verification",2016-04-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

Therefore, data management approaches for smart environments need to support flexibility, dynamicity, incremental change, while keeping costs to a minimum. A Dataspace is an emerging approach to data management that has proved fruitful for personal information and scientific data management. However, their use within smart environments and for real-time data remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as an enabling platform for data management within smart environments. This paper identifies common data management requirements for smart energy and water environments, details the RLD architecture and the key support services and their tiered support levels, and a principled approach to “Pay-As-You-Go” data management. The paper presents a dataspace query service for real-time data streams and entities to enable unified entity-centric queries across live and historical stream data. The RLD was validated in 5 real-world pilot smart environments following the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop to build real-time analytics, decisions support, and smart apps for energy and water management. The pilots demonstrate that the RLD enables incremental pay-as-you-go data management with support services that simplify the development of applications and analytics for smart environments.

The evolution of IT systems has currently arrived at a level that involves complex systems integration and business ecosystems in which many stakeholders in different roles are involved. A new paradigm for digital innovation is needed that copes with this increased complexity. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an empirically informed framework for analysing and designing viable, sustainable digital innovation ecosystems in the agri-food domain. METHODS: The research is based on a series of European large-scale public-private innovation projects from 2011 to 2021 with a total budget of 73 M€. They involved hundreds of stakeholders that were developing a large number of digital solutions through which a digital innovation ecosystem for agri-food was formed. In a longitudinal study, a conceptual framework was used to analyse these projects and describe how the digital innovation ecosystem has developed. Lessons learnt are translated into a number of design principles and an organizational approach to foster digital innovation ecosystems in agri-food. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The conceptual framework consists of 6 key concepts: (i) innovation strategy, (ii) innovation organization, (iii) innovation network that contains (iv) the innovation process and (v) the innovation object and finally (vi) an innovation infrastructure. Along these 6 concepts, lessons learnt and in total 21 design principles are derived from analysing the projects forming a basis for the organizational framework. At the core of this framework is a lean multi-actor approach to trials and use case development interacting with a set of multidisciplinary activities: (i) developing a common technical collaboration infrastructure, (ii) identifying value streams with user engagement, (iii) engaging the right partners and stakeholders at the right time supported by strategic project planning and dynamic management. The most important conclusion is that effective, successful and quick use of appropriate IT in agri-food requires that actors should not be analysed in isolation from both their technological and business environment. Another consequence is that a ‘minimal viable ecosystem’ only emerges after considerable time, resources and ingenuity is invested and may require outside (government) intervention. SIGNIFICANCE: Results from this paper can be used both by public and private stakeholders to diagnose and improve digital innovation projects and develop viable, sustainable digital innovation ecosystems in agri-food.","Business ecosystems, Digital agriculture, Digital transformation, Innovation infrastructure, Innovation organization",2023-01-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

In fact, the market needs an economic support to accelerate the transition towards new paradigms for the development of the software components of a mechatronic system.

Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between “everything”, IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytic tools are able to extract “sense” from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.","Big Data, Data science, Internet of Things, Smart factories, Software platforms",2018-05-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

Platforms that enable the efficient application of those solutions at the right level (machine, edge, plant or cloud) are also necessary.(p)(/p)This paper presents an industrial case study on the application of the Arrowhead framework. The framework is implemented in the Machine Tooling ecosystem and enables the integration of grinding machines with other sensors, components or machines. Different software engineering tools offered with Arrowhead are used to design new solutions in Cyber-Physical System and Internet of Things in Industry 4.0 and make them Arrowhead compliant, for fast deployment of platforms and applications (Dockers) or for testing purposes (Management tool). Finally, the potential of agile construction of new applications is analysed by providing an Human-Machine Interface at machine level and the provision of services for data consumption at cloud level.","Arrowhead, Cyber-Physical System, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things",2020-10-19,eng,Conference,Vittoriano

Services, in such applications, enable the emergence of multiple end-to-end cyber-physical scenarios, formed dynamically based on their demands, e.g., Disaster recovery systems. This calls for new distributed service composition models that integrate different CPS services from multiple application domains for a given purpose - CPS ecosystems. The in-Cloud availability of CPSs can significantly improve the development process of such ecosystems thanks to the global and rapid accessibility of CPS services in the Cloud. However, a major challenge in this context is the highly dynamic nature of CPS services, making service composition a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose to exploit the concept of models at runtime in order to create a dynamic middleware framework that allows efficient composition of CPS services in dynamic and on-demand CPS ecosystems. This is achieved by obtaining the runtime models of CPS services and synthesizing software mediators that translate the communications between individual CPS services residing in the Cloud. The in-Cloud availability of CPS services will facilitate the design of such a middleware framework, and processing and maintaining the runtime models.","Cloud, Cyber-physical systems, Ecosystems, Models at runtime, Service composition",2014-12-15,eng,Conference,Vittoriano

However, deciding a proper OSS to be adopted or to contribute to its development is a complex and error-prone task. Analyzing the OSS ecosystem (OSSECO) health may help providing information about: (1) the OSS itself (number of commits, days after the last release, etc.); and (2) their main actors (number of contributors, partners, etc.). There exist proposals that go further and provide aggregated high-level indicators (e.g. visibility as an aggregation of number of community events, number of partners, and other metrics). Nevertheless, there is a lack of useful OSSECO analysis tools to ease the decision making on which OSSECO has the health required by a potential OSS adopter or contributor. In this work, we provide OSS-CARE (OSSeCo heAlthy monitoR and analysEr), an OSS-independent, fully automatic, and real-time framework to assess OSSECO's health. OSS-CARE supports defining the ecosystem health objectives of potential OSS adopters, OSS contributors, and even OSS managers to inspect their provided health. These objectives are defined based on a well-established model characterizing health metrics that can be potentially aggregated by using a Bayesian network technique. Moreover, the integrated monitoring and analysis components perform an automated assessment of OSSECO's health by checking the fulfillment of the required health objectives. Furthermore, the result is shown in an appealing dashboard that may ease the complex decision making of which OSS to choose.","Ecosystem health, Monitoring, Open Source Software (OSS), Open Source Software Ecosystem (OSSECO)",2023-07-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano

In this publication, we share our software development experiences from the Digital Villages project. The major goal in this project is to support rural areas with digital services running on a platform. While typical software engineering activities such as design, implementation, or testing are, of course, necessary further on, evaluation and incorporating feedback from users play a far more important role when going towards digital ecosystems.

Such devices, commonly called Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with sensing/actuation capabilities, are becoming capable of managing the complexity of communications over the Internet. Nevertheless, the IoT ecosystem is still fragmented due to the different used vertical solutions. This heterogeneity makes IoT devices/systems unable to communicate seamlessly, leading to limited cooperation and tightly coupled deployments. To deal with the interoperability issues in IoT, we propose, in this paper, a Cloud-based approach with a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) mechanism enabling the IoT devices to communicate using the Representational state transfer (REST) model: an approach that follows the Web of things (WoT) paradigm. In particular, the system makes the IoT devices' hosted resources (e.g., sensors and actuators) able to be steered using globally resolvable (over the Internet) Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) even when deployed behind Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls. The system we conceived requires only one public registered domain name to associate, for all the distributed IoT devices, sub-domains of the public one while using a clever routing mechanism. An online implementation of the testbed is provided to show the feasibility of the approach. Further, a performance evaluation of the system is reported to assess the resource usage of the solution.","cloud computing, cyber physical systems, Internet of Things, openstack, REST, Web of Things, web services",2022-01-01,eng,Journal,Vittoriano
