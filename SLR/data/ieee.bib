For their efficient engineering, these twins need to become Systems-of-Systems (SoS), in which digital twins of smaller systems (e.g., a production machine) become parts of digital twins of larger systems (e.g., a factory). Yet, research on digital twins as SoS largely ignores reusing digital twins in SoS. Based on our experience in engineering digital twins with experts from various domains related to production systems engineering, we present insights on the challenges of composing and integrating that need to be addressed for efficient engineering of digital twins as SoS. These insights may guide future research on engineering digital twins as well as practitioners considering the challenges in building and composing digital twin systems-of-systems.},

The resulting systems are called Systems of Systems (SoSs). Software and systems engineering can make contributions to the necessary transformation of these systems. SoSs that are characterized by special dynamics (e.g., more frequent context changes) are referred to as dynamic SoSs (dynaSoS). Currently, there are still many open questions and challenges in their design and realization. In order to get an overview of these, in this paper we present a survey that was executed within the context of the project “DynaSoS”. For this purpose, qualitative interviews were conducted with experts in software and SoS engineering from industry and academia. Based on the statements received, 36 challenges were grouped and prioritized in several workshops. This report provides an overview of ten central software engineering issues and research challenges in the realization of dynaSoS and aims to contribute to a better understanding of the application-oriented challenges facing industry.},

The COSMIXER-CPPS is able to control devices with different interfaces and protocols as well as to communicate with external databases and web-services. The unified communication middleware within the CPPS enables furthermore the reconfiguration and scaling of the system with minimal disruption.

These systems are known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). While these systems open new opportunities to deliver improved quality of life for people and reinvigorate computing, their engineering is a difficult problem given the level of heterogeneity and dynamism they exhibit. While progress has been made, we argue that complexity is now at a level such that existing approaches need a major re-think to define principles and associated techniques for CPS. In this paper, we identify research challenges when modelling, analysing and engineering CPS. We focus on three key topics: theoretical foundations of CPS, self-adaptation methods for CPS, and exemplars of CPS serving as a research vehicle shared by a larger community. For each topic, we present an overview and suggest future research directions, thereby focusing on selected challenges. This paper is one of the results of the Shonan Seminar 118 on Modelling and Analysing Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems, which took place in December 2018.},

Services, in such applications, enable the emergence of multiple end-to-end cyber-physical scenarios, formed dynamically based on their demands, e.g., Disaster recovery systems. This calls for new distributed service composition models that integrate different CPS services from multiple application domains for a given purpose -- CPS ecosystems. The in-Cloud availability of CPSs can significantly improve the development process of such ecosystems thanks to the global and rapid accessibility of CPS services in the Cloud. However, a major challenge in this context is the highly dynamic nature of CPS services, making service composition a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose to exploit the concept of models at runtime in order to create a dynamic middleware framework that allows efficient composition of CPS services in dynamic and on-demand CPS ecosystems. This is achieved by obtaining the runtime models of CPS services and synthesizing software mediators that translate the communications between individual CPS services residing in the Cloud. The in-Cloud availability of CPS services will facilitate the design of such a middleware framework, and processing and maintaining the runtime models.},

Agility, privacy, and regulatory compliance are some of the advantages of hybrid clouds. However, the key characteristics of complex hybrid cloud application such as heterogeneity, reliability, interoperability, scalability, and dynamic nature also makes old static approaches brittle. A digital twin can capture real-time (meta) data of a hybrid cloud application and supply valuable insights for efficient management of the cloud services and analyzing faults. In this paper, we propose a digital twin assisted approach to analyze the faults, interoperability, and reliability issues of a hybrid cloud-based application. We also present some metamorphic relations to analyze the reliability of our twin. Insights from the digital twin can assist developers to take proactive measures before a fault occur. The digital twin can also help detect faults and identify the cause and remediation steps through data insights. The key advantage of using digital twin is that it helps detect issues in complex hybrid cloud applications in a holistic way.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering; • Computer systems organization → Embedded and cyber-physical systems;},

Then, we present a design-time SoS representation along with a toolchain concept aiding SoS design and deployment. This brings us to reasoning about what potential workflows are thinkable for specifying comprehensive toolchains along with their data exchange interfaces. We also discuss the potential of aligning our vision with RAMI4.0, as well as the utilization perspectives for real-life engineering use-cases.},

Cyber-Physical Systems provide a unified framework for connecting the abstract computational artifacts with the physical world. This allows for robust and flexible architectural design with multi-scale dynamics and integrated wired and wireless networking for managing the flows of mass, energy, and information in a coherent way. An example of Cyber Physical Systems is connecting sensors (which provide information from the physical world) to the internet (which represents the cyber world). Cyber-Physical Systems has recently been listed as the No.1 research priority by the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Cyber-Physical Systems framework has the capability to tackle numerous scientific, social and economical issues. However, building Cyber-Physical Systems is not a trivial task. It requires a new ground-breaking theory that models cyber and physical resources in a unified framework. Digital Ecosystems constitute a superset which includes these Cyber Physical systems. Thus the underlying theories of Digital Ecosystems will help to provide important pointers to the development of these Cyber Physical Systems. None of the current state-of-the-art methods are able to overcome the challenges of building such Cyber Physical Systems due to the fact that computer science and theories underlying the real world have developed independently based on overly-simplified assumptions of each other. For example, many key requirements (e.g. uncertainty, inaccuracy, etc.) crucial to physical systems are not captured and fully dealt within the computer science research agenda. Similarly computational complexity, system evolution, software failure and failures of computer hardware are often ignored from the viewpoint of theories of the physical world, which treats computation as a precise, error-free, static `black-box'. The solution to Cyber-Physical Systems must break the boundary between the cyber world and the physical world by providing a unified infrastructure that permits integrated models addressing issues from both worlds simultaneously. Therefore, in this keynote, we explore an approach to such an infrastructure using the framework of Digital Ecosystems.},

Despite the novelty of the area as it has been known, it follows a trend of previous complex systems, such as Federated Information Systems and Large-Scale Information Systems. However, operational and managerial independence of IS constituents have created a new type of system that must be understood to suitably support new business and modernize old ones, such as pizza delivery via drone swarms. Hence, to sustain the area and achieve advances, it is necessary to externalize the state of the art and practice of the area. However, the lack of literature mappings on this topic can hamper the evolution of the area and pose difficulties to its progress, besides making it difficult to obtain relevant information about existing gaps and advances that could be made in the future. This paper presents results of a Systematic Mapping (SM) carried out to investigate the status quo of SoIS domain. We bring a panorama of this research topic and also indicate research perspectives. From a set of 212 studies, 25 were selected, analyzed and had their data extracted. Results reveal that interoperability between different IS is still a challenge and the low number of studies referring to languages, techniques and tools for modeling SoIS architectures points to an important area of study to be researched in the next years.},

At the same time, however, trustworthiness assurance is becoming extremely difficult in these complex ecosystems due to the high autonomy, unpredictability and limited controllability of their individual players. To mitigate safety risks for humans, these Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems (e.g., Smart Cities) might require their member systems (e.g., Autonomous Vehicles) to execute software modules called Smart Agents to ensure safe coordination among themselves. Unfortunately, this technology is currently in its very early development with many challenges ahead. Namely, there is no guaranteed way of ensuring that these agents run on the right piece of hardware, with the right privileges required to fulfill their roles, and without the execution environment tampering with their instructions. This way, the host system (e.g., the Autonomous Vehicle we need to control for the sake of the safety of other ecosystem members) can escape the actual safety measures to be enforced. In this paper, we are proposing a novel software architecture that focuses on the detection of instruction tampering and privileged access in Smart Agents, and this way support the vision of trustworthy and safe evolution of Dynamic Autonomous Ecosystems.},

	abstract     = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) utilize different devices to collect sensitive data, communicate with other systems, and monitor essential processes in critical infrastructure applications. However, in the ecosystem of CPS, unauthorized or spoofed devices may danger or compromise the performance and security of the critical infrastructure. The unauthorized and spoofed devices may include tampered pieces of software or hardware components that can negatively impact CPS operations or collect vital CPS metrics from the network. Such devices can be outsider or insider threats trying to impersonate other real CPS devices via spoofing their legitimate identifications to gain access to systems, steal information, or spread malware. Device fingerprinting techniques are promising approaches to identify unauthorized or illegitimate devices. However, current fingerprinting solutions are not suitable as they disrupt critical real-time operations in CPS due to the nature of their extensive data analysis or too much overhead on the devices' computational resources. To address these concerns, in this work, we propose STOP-AND- FRISK (S&F), a novel fingerprinting framework to identify CPS device classes and complement traditional security mechanisms in CPS. S&F is based on a secure challenge/response mechanism that analyzes the behavior of the CPS devices at both the hardware and OS/kernel levels. Specifically, the proposed novel mechanism combines system and function call tracing techniques, signal processing, and hardware performance analysis to create specific device-class signatures. Then, the signatures are correlated against known behavioral ground-truth to identify the device types. To test the efficacy of S&F extensively, we implemented a realistic testbed that included different classes of CPS devices with a variety of computing resources, architectures, and configurations. Our experimental results reveal an excellent rate on the CPS device-class identification. Finally, extensive performance analysis demonstrates that the use of S&F yields minimal overhead on the CPS devices' computing resources.},

Although the latest industry infrastructures largely depend on AI-driven maintenance, prediction based on corrupted data undoubtedly results in loss of life and capital. Admittedly, an inadequate data protection mechanism can readily challenge the security and reliability of the network. The shortcomings of the conventional cloud or trust-ed-certificate-driven techniques have motivated us to exhibit a unique blockchain-based framework for a secure and efficient Industry 4.0 system. The demonstrated framework obviates the long-established certificate authority after enhancing the consortium blockchain that reduces the data processing delay and increases cost-effective throughput. Nonetheless, the distributed Industry 4.0 security model entails cooperative trust rather than depending on a single party, which in essence indulges the costs and threat of the single point of failure. Therefore, the multi-signature technique of the proposed framework accomplishes multi-party authentication, which confirms its applicability for a real-time and collaborative cyber-physical system.},

We have built upon our previous work and have addressed some of the educational and research challenges associated with the prior work. The critical contributions of the paper to the robotics and automation community are threefold: First, OpenUAV saves students and researchers from tedious and complicated software setups by providing web-browser-based Linux desktop sessions with standard robotics software like Gazebo, ROS, and flight autonomy stack. Second, a method for saving an individual's research work with its dependencies for the work's future reproducibility. Third, the platform provides a mechanism to support photorealistic robotics simulations by combining Unity game engine-based camera rendering and Gazebo physics. The paper addresses a research need for photorealistic simulations and describes a methodology for creating a photorealistic aquatic simulation. We also present the various academic and research use-cases of this platform to improve robotics education and research, especially during times like the COVID-19 pandemic, when virtual collaboration is necessary.

These services enable the emergence of multiple end-to-end cyber-physical scenarios, formed dynamically based on their demands, e.g., disaster recovery systems. In such scenarios, each cyber-physical flow may be composed of a large number of physical services with composition challenges such as high dynamism of CPS platforms, rapid development and scalability, and real-time and reliable processing and controlling tasks. Cloud computing enables new perspectives in the design and operation of CPSs, including consolidating and sharing physical services among different applications, auto-scaling computing and communication, and designing and maintaining multiple in-Cloud CPSs dynamically at the same time. In this paper, we present a new architectural approach to address the key concerns of a new generation of CPS services whose functionalities reside in-Cloud (cyber), and on devices and systems (physical). In particular, this design space is focused on principles that allow in-Cloud evolution of CPS services, including dynamic in-Cloud service composition and distribution, virtualization of physical services and devices, and the dynamic creation of CPS ecosystems. In this design model, the in-Cloud cyber part may evolve independently, while the on-device cyber and physical platform still work closely together and provide the basic CPS services.},

Many disciplines can benefit from the advancement of the Metaverse when accurately developed, including the fields of technology, gaming, education, art & culture, socialization, commerce, and businesses. Nevertheless, developing the Metaverse environment to its full potential is an ambiguous task that needs proper guidance and directions. Existing surveys on the Metaverse focus only on a specific aspect and discipline of the Metaverse and lack a holistic view of the entire process. Moreover, most surveys refrain from providing detailed guidance about the development process of the metaverse, including its impact on technologies, businesses, existing challenges, and potential research directions due to their lack of a macro and micro perception of such a topic. To this end, a more holistic, multi-disciplinary, in-depth, and academic and industry-oriented review is required to provide a thorough study of the Metaverse development pipeline and fill the gap in existing Metaverse surveys. To address these issues, we present in this survey a novel multi-layered pipeline ecosystem composed of (1) the Metaverse computing, networking, communications and hardware infrastructure, (2) environment digitization, and (3) user interactions. For every layer, we discuss the components that detail the steps of its development. Also, for each of these components, we examine the impact of a set of enabling technologies and empowering domains (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Security & Privacy, Blockchain, Business, Ethics, and Social) on its advancement. In addition, we explain the importance of these technologies to support decentralization, interoperability, user experiences, interactions, and monetization. Our presented study highlights the existing challenges for each component, followed by research directions and potential solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most comprehensive and allows users, scholars, and entrepreneurs to get an in-depth understanding of the Metaverse ecosystem to find their opportunities and potentials for contribution.},

In the IoT, the collaborating entities encompass both physical and virtual resources, interactions occur both in an active and programmed way as well as by chance, and therefore it is necessary to deal with expected but also emerging behaviors of the collaborating parties. In this paper, we first discuss the main features that make IoT a unique ecosystem, and as such, calls for new software development solutions. We claim that there is a need to rethinking the techniques and methodologies for developing IoT systems and applications. Novel models, architectural approaches and techniques should be proposed, or existing ones should be adapted to deal with the high heterogeneity, dynamism, serendipity and interdependencies that are typical of the IoT ecosystem. We then analyze and discuss potential key design solutions that deserve a deeper understanding in order to pave the way for the building of this new generation of systems.

However, conceptual challenges related to the actors definition arise when mapping new digital applications to SGAM, among others such as artificial intelligence and digital twins.Thus, this paper explores the latter challenges and presents three potential solutions to facilitate the deployment of digital applications in SGAM. These solutions are (i) the integration of a new interoperability layer to cover digital applications and humans in the current SGAM design, (ii) the decoupling of the component layer in three layers regarding the typology of actors, and (iii) the integration of a new interoperability layer to better represent the digital actors in cyber-physical applications.},

	abstract     = {The ever-growing trend of making the traditional power grids smarter than before has resulted in their gradual evolution to more sophisticated grids, referred to as Smart Grids (SGs) Cyber-Physical Systems with complex networking technologies. The integration of Information and Communication Technologies with power grids fosters seamless data sharing between different SG entities, which supports effective and smart governance in terms of demand response management, frequency support, and voltage stabilization. Nonetheless, this integration opens up several security and privacy concerns, namely, electricity theft, power loss, battery exhaustion, infrastructure mapping, etc. These issues become even more important with the addition of distributed energy sources, e.g. electric vehicles (EVs), battery energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources, into the SGs. We present a framework based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) and BlockChain (BC) to address two challenging issues of EV-aided SG ecosystems, namely, privacy assurance and power security. We leverage the capabilities of SDN to handle the complex interactions between different subsystems of the SG. Furthermore, we also employ BC and smart contracts' properties to secure energy transactions and data communications. We design a secure and efficient mutual authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and BC for privacy preservation during smart energy trading. We also proposed a BC-based smart contract for effective Demand Response Management (DRM) during bidirectional energy transfer between EVs and SG. Finally, we present experimental evaluations to validate the proposed framework's performance. The results obtained demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. The mutual authentication protocol designed is not only secure against major attack vectors (namely, session key security, message integrity, anonymity, forward secrecy, and so on), but it is also cost-efficient in terms of communication and computational costs. Additionally, the SC designed assures power security and maintains an adequate balance between demand and supply.},

In the era of IoT, millions of smart computing things are connected to solve customized applications. The tenets of IoT design are agility, scalability and security. Security is one of the important tenets for the success of IoT. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and possible solutions for IoT security that needs to be addressed at IoT perception layer/Edge node. The inevitable component of the IoT edge node is microcontroller/System on Chip (SoC). The microcontroller/SoC used in sensitive applications consists of Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a hardware support for security. TEE's are not sufficient to address all the security issues in IoT systems.Hardware security issues like hardware Trojans, counterfeiting and debug security are tightly interlinked with the IoT perception layer security. There can be common solution to the hardware security issues and IoT perception layer security. In this paper, we briefly discuss the challenges in IoT design, IoT security, vulnerabilities of edge device, existing solutions and need for new security architecture for IoT edge nodes. And finally we present what security features, the next generation SoC/microcontrollers should incorporate to solve both hardware intrinsic security and IoT perception layer security more holistically.},

Interoperability among devices and machines is one of the challenges. Sensors, components and machines from different vendors work as independent silos offering large amounts of heterogeneous data which relational capabilities are not fully exploited. Quick development, deployment and testing of new software solutions that take advantage of those data is another important matter. The requirements in terms of equipment resources and engineering efforts is high when planning new implementations. Platforms that enable the efficient application of those solutions at the right level (machine, edge, plant or cloud) are also necessary.(p)(/p)This paper presents an industrial case study on the application of the Arrowhead framework. The framework is implemented in the Machine Tooling ecosystem and enables the integration of grinding machines with other sensors, components or machines. Different software engineering tools offered with Arrowhead are used to design new solutions in Cyber-Physical System and Internet of Things in Industry 4.0 and make them Arrowhead compliant, for fast deployment of platforms and applications (Dockers) or for testing purposes (Management tool). Finally, the potential of agile construction of new applications is analysed by providing an Human-Machine Interface at machine level and the provision of services for data consumption at cloud level.},

Similar to digital factories, smart factories signify a greater digital convergence between manufacturing Operational Technology (OT), and wider enterprise Integrated Technology (IT). With these new capabilities comes new challenges in scale, complexity, and the skills needed to enable ubiquitous system integration. While in the past, engineers have utilized a variety of proprietary graphical configuration and programming tools to intuitively create simple to complex manufacturing systems, presently, the standard technology ecosystem which engineers design, control, and maintain, is observably expanding, and/or evolving to incorporate more open-source technologies, network services, and distributed devices. Therefore, this paper will examine the emerging next generation technologies and tools which will support engineers in designing and interacting with the new digital manufacturing ecosystem in smart factories. To achieve this: a state-of-the-art survey of commercial Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology is presented; three key ubiquitous technology trends are examined; and a use-case is presented with a universal framework.

	abstract     = {The cyber-physical system (CPS) is a promising technique that enables a safety-critical industry ecosystem. In general, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things are the sensing and communication infrastructures for CPS. Currently, software-defined networking (SDN) have been used as the new networking architecture for typical WSNs and CPS. However, there are two unresolved problems for a software-defined CPS. First, a feasible systemic architecture is a must for software-defined CPS, which should provide a global virtualization management and closed-loop control between the cyber side and the physical side in a CPS. Second, the lifetime of a software-defined CPS scenario needs to be extended for critical applications. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a systematic virtual networking architecture to perform the global virtualization control and monitoring of a CPS, in which network functions virtualization (NFV) configuration and orchestration can be realized. Moreover, based on the proposed architecture, a novel lifetime extension scheme (NLES), is proposed for a software-defined CPS. To orchestrate the resource dynamically and efficiently, the instant programmability of an SDN and instant deployment capability of NFV are utilized to control the topology of node modes of a CPS. Then, a game theoretic topology decision approach is proposed to control the topology of the clustering and virtual network function deployment of sensors at run-time in a CPS. The experimental results show that NLES has longer lifetime compared to those of the traditional schemes.},

Nonetheless, the communication on public channel among different IIoT entities in an SDN-enabled environment may be exposed to various security threats due to wireless and insecure communication channels. To counter these security challenges in the way of wider CPS or IIoT adoption, we propose a novel three-factor authenticated key exchange mechanism (SUSIC) for SDN-enabled IIoT ecosystem. The SUSIC enables a registered user to access real-time data from physical IIoT environment directly after having mutual authentication performed through SDN-enabled controller node. The scheme is proved to be secure under rigorous formal and informal security analysis. Moreover, the simulation results and performance evaluation signifies toward achieving a better tradeoff between security functionalities and computational overheads comparatively.},

Containerization allows for better resource utilization, platform-independent development, and secure deployment of software. Orchestration automates the deployment, networking, scaling, and availability of containerized workloads and services. While containerization is increasingly being adopted in the robotic community, the use of task orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) is still an open challenge. The biggest limitation is due to the fact that state-of-the-art orchestrators do not support real-time (RT) containers, while advanced robotic software often consists of a mix of heterogeneous tasks (i.e., ROS nodes) with different levels of temporal constraints (i.e., mixed-criticality systems). This work addresses this challenge by presenting RT-Kube, a platform that extends the de-facto reference standard for container orchestration, Kubernetes, to schedule tasks with mixed-criticality requirements. It implements monitoring of tasks and detects missed deadlines for those with RT constraints. It selects low-priority tasks to be migrated at runtime to different units of the computing cluster to free resources and recover from temporal violations. We present quantitative experimental results on the software implementing the mission of a Robotnik RB-Kairos mobile robot to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Nevertheless, the IoT ecosystem is still fragmented due to the different used vertical solutions. This heterogeneity makes IoT devices/systems unable to communicate seamlessly, leading to limited cooperation and tightly coupled deployments. To deal with the interoperability issues in IoT, we propose, in this paper, a Cloud-based approach with a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) mechanism enabling the IoT devices to communicate using the Representational state transfer (REST) model: an approach that follows the Web of things (WoT) paradigm. In particular, the system makes the IoT devices’ hosted resources (e.g., sensors and actuators) able to be steered using globally resolvable (over the Internet) Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) even when deployed behind Network Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls. The system we conceived requires only one public registered domain name to associate, for all the distributed IoT devices, sub-domains of the public one while using a clever routing mechanism. An online implementation of the testbed is provided to show the feasibility of the approach. Further, a performance evaluation of the system is reported to assess the resource usage of the solution.},

As a matter of fact, the CPS growing market potential is scarcely supported by tools able to sustain the solid ecosystem required for a relevant market uptake. This issue becomes even more constraining the moment the concept of CPS is extended and aggregated to propose cyber-physical machines and manufacturing systems, where the complexity of the controlling intelligence and of the digital counterpart explodes. This paper aims at describing how the design and implementation of a multi-sided platform (MSP) for CPS deployment within the automation sector can provide the technological background to incentivize their adoption. In fact, the market needs an economic support to accelerate the transition towards new paradigms for the development of the software components of a mechatronic system. Developing an infrastructure on the top of which the CPS value chain can be instantiated and orchestrated, we provide the technical means to incentivize the creation of such an ecosystem able to support SMEs in their transition towards Industry 4.0.},

However, the limited memory resources of mobile systems and virtualization's memory demanding feature post challenges on main memory. Fortunately, non-volatile random access memory(NVRAM) provides opportunities to solve the problem with its attractive features, such as high density, low standby power and so on. However, the long write latency of NVRAM may slow down the performance of write-intensive tasks. Time-critical tasks may end up with unbearable performance. In this paper, we therefore focus on improving the performance of mobile virtualization with NVRAM/DRAM hybrid main memory. To achieve this, we propose NV-CFS, an user-centric virtual machine scheduler built for the ARM/KVM hypervisor. Experimental results based on various pseudo-randomly selected task sets show that NV-CFS can improve the performance more than 30%, and significantly reduce the task deadline miss ratio when compared to the traditional scheduling algorithm.},

Several works have been pushing towards visual programming solutions to abstract the underlying complexity and help humans reason about it. As these solutions begin to meet widespread adoption, their building blocks usually do not consider reliability issues. Node-RED, being one of the most popular tools, also lacks such mechanisms, either built-in or via extensions. In this work we present SHEN (Self-Healing Extensions for Node-RED) which provides 17 nodes that collectively enable the implementation of self-healing strategies within this visual framework.

Digitization of complex cyber-physical systems is a promising approach to bringing into action the massive deployment of PV panels in the energy system. In this paper, we will focus on the computational tools for Digital Twining PV modules as they are an enabler of digitalization. The current study represents the initial phase of a project aimed at designing the Digital Twin of a PV module, which encompasses three primary objectives: firstly, enhancing the resilience of the energy system; secondly, introducing the concept of the Internet of Energy; and thirdly, establishing the Digital Twin as a service (DTaaS). The article details the comparison between open-source tools (pvlib, Photovoltaic-Modeling) with commercial software (Matlab Sim-scape) that forms the backbone of the computational Digital Twins of a PV module. The results show that none of the numerical models performs well under low irradiation conditions. Moreover, the benchmarking reveals a significant disparity in the estimation of shunt resistance $(R_{sh})$ between the open-source library (Photo-voltaic Modeling) and the commercial tool.},

	abstract     = {Satellite technologies are used for both civil and military purposes in the modern world, and typical applications include Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) services, which have a direct impact several economic, social and environmental protection activity. The increasing reliance on satellite services for safety-of-life and mission-critical applications (e.g., transport, defense and public safety services) creates a severe, although often overlooked, security problem, particularly when it comes to cyber threats. Like other increasingly digitized services, satellites and space platforms are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Thus, the existence of cybersecurity flaws may pose major threats to space-based assets and associated key infrastructure on the ground. These dangers could obstruct global economic progress and, by implication, international security if they are not properly addressed. Mega-constellations make protecting space infrastructure from cyberattacks much more difficult. This emphasizes the importance of defensive cyber countermeasures to minimize interruptions and ensure efficient and reliable contributions to critical infrastructure operations. Very importantly, space systems are inherently complex Cyber-Physical System (CPS) architectures, where communication, control and computing processes are tightly interleaved, and associated hardware/software components are seamlessly integrated. This represents a new challenge as many known physical threats (e.g., conventional electronic warfare measures) can now manifest their effects in cyberspace and, vice-versa, some cyber-threats can have detrimental effects in the physical domain. The concept of cyberspace underlies nearly every aspect of modern society’s critical activities and relies heavily on critical infrastructure for economic advancement, public safety and national security. Many governments have expressed the desire to make a substantial contribution to secure cyberspace and are focusing on different aspects of the evolving industrial ecosystem, largely under the impulse of digital transformation and sustainable development goals. The level of cybersecurity attained in this framework is the sum of all national and international activities implemented to protect all actions in the cyber-physical ecosystem. This paper focuses on cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in various segments of space CPS architectures. More specifically, the paper identifies the applicable cyber threat mechanisms, conceivable threat actors and the associated space business implications. It also presents metrics and strategies for countering cyber threats and facilitating space mission assurance.},

Therefore, ensuring the resilience of green energy infrastructure demands a distinct approach, particularly regarding the security and safety aspects of these CIs. Green Energy CIs have less inherent protection, along with ancillary protection facilities compared to conventional power plants. This underscores the need to leverage AI to enhance the safety and security of green energy infrastructures, providing efficient and cost-effective solutions. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AI implementations for enhancing the security and safety of green energy. Although this study is a work in progress, the present article will specifically delve into the resilience aspects of green energy infrastructures. Given the focus on AI implementation and data-driven solutions, we approach energy systems from a cyber-physical and societal perspective, emphasizing their broader impact on society. The ongoing study has unveiled significant improvements in resilience through the application of AI methods and data-driven models, such as machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, multiagent systems, big data, and data mining. Furthermore, we explore the challenges associated with integrating AI into green energy systems and investigate its various applications. This exploration aims to identify key features that will guide the development of novel approaches to enhancing the resilience of green energy systems through AI-based solutions for security and safety.

Despite its advancements, 5G encounters several challenges. To tackle these issues, global industrial, academic, and standards organizations are actively researching on sixth generation (6G) wireless communication systems. 6G networks are envisioned as a transformative shift in the interactions between the physical, digital, and human realms, paving the way for a pervasive human-centered cyber-physical world. 6G is positioned to be a platform that offers communication and beyond communication services considering both performance and value centric technological development approaches. In this paper, we present the way forward towards the design of 6G endto-end (E2E) system as a consolidated view of leading industry stakeholders and academia in the European level 6G flagship project Hexa-X-II. We discuss the key challenges with 5G and how 6G is expected to tackle those by introducing new technological innovations and supporting novel use case requirements. We provide a comprehensive methodology for the design of a 6G E2E system including ten principles, a blueprint, and a structured design process. The architecture design principles prioritize environmental sustainability, digital inclusiveness, and trustworthiness, considering their impact on the 6G E2E system. The blueprint is described corresponding to the infrastructure, network centric application, and application layers, as well as the pervasive functionalities and the relevant technological innovations. Following the design principles and the system blueprint, the design process is demonstrated as two-way approaches (i.e., 1) key performance and value indicators based design process. 2) top-down versus bottom-up alignment process) through the lens of a collaborative robot use case. Through this use case, a special attention is given to the technological enablers that cover management and orchestration functionalities and their 6G enhancement to go beyond the limitations characterizing the previous network generation. In addition, virtual modelling aspects related to digital twining and simulations for 6G E2E system design are also discussed.},

Based on their ubiquity, embedded use of AI and ML within industry faces a major paradox; as AI and ML technologies empower and streamline operations while providing transformative benefits to users, they simultaneously introduce formidable threats through security vulnerabilities that can cause massive damage if not defended against.

	abstract     = {Industry 4.0 is all about doing things in a concurrent, secure, and fine-grained manner. Internet of Things edge sensors and their associated data play a predominant role in today’s industry ecosystem. Breaching data or forging source devices after injecting advanced persistent threats (APTs) damages the industry owners’ money and loss of operators’ lives. The existing challenges include APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data storing mechanisms, etc. Edge servers often suffer because of their lightweight computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which, in essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers while transporting data using traditional public-key infrastructure-rendered trusts, consortium blockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning, edge devices can filter malicious data at their end, which largely motivates us to institute a blockchain and artificial intelligence-aligned APT detection system. The unique contributions of this article include efficient APT detection at the edge and transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boosts trust among collaborators and ensures an economical and sustainable mechanism after eliminating existing certificate authority. Finally, the edge-compliant storage technique facilitates efficient predictive maintenance. The respective experimental outcomes reveal that the proposed technique outperforms the other competing systems and models.},

	abstract     = {The advent of VLSI technologies has provided a breakthrough in IC manufacturing processes leading to a substantial increase in the population of a low footprint and low power mobile computing devices. A network of such devices that can communicate with one another can aid in the realisation of a ubiquitous and pervasive computing ecosystem. If these participating devices are vehicles, then they form a particular class of mobile peer-to-peer network categorised as Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET). The devices which mainly include cars, are highly mobile thus posing numerous challenges in interdevice communication, synchronisation and sharing of data. Monitoring vehicular and battery health, movement, identification, etc. on the run are challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we describe an attempt to transform a vehicle into a mobile computing node that can host a multi-agent platform. With static agent(s) resident on these platforms and mobile agents flitting across these vehicles, we explain how a Road Side Unit (RSU) can track and obtain information about the traffic. Since these agents are autonomous pieces of static or mobile software, it is not only possible for them to obtain information about the vehicle but also gain control over it, if required. Further, since mobile agents can migrate from one vehicle to another, they possess the ability to aggregate or disseminate information on the status of the traffic. In this paper, we discuss MAVNet, a mobile agent-based framework for vehicular networks where we propose the deployment of mobile agents for data acquisition, on-board processing and sharing within a network of vehicles and the infrastructure based RSUs. As a proof-of-concept, a partial real-world deployment along with an experimental have been discussed in the paper.},

A current line of action is the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which can be monitored and controlled by private clouds or edge systems. Our approach is to bring functionalities, such as analytics, as close to the devices as possible (denoted as Fog Computing) to reduce latency and enhance data privacy and communication robustness. As a starting point we're extending a standard-compliant Machine-To-Machine Communication (M2M) architecture with container based orchestration mechanisms to enable CPSs to be programmable, autonomous and to communicate peer-to-peer.

	abstract     = {Smart Parking Systems have emerged as a transformative solution to address the growing challenges associated with urbanization and increasing vehicular traffic. Such system integrates sensors, cameras, and other IoT connected devices to monitor parking spaces in real time. However, there are many security vulnerabilities in existing solutions, especially when it comes to car authentication at parking entry points. IoT sensors my be susceptible to Cyber-attacks and fraudulent activities, such as car theft, can exploit these vulnerabilities due to limited built-in security features. The reliability of authentication systems, based on IoT sensors can also be compromised by factors such as extreme weather conditions and physical damage. The cyber-physical solution we propose relies on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for identification and authentication in IoT devices to mitigate these challenges. The use of PUFs enhances the reliability and security of smart parking systems against unauthorized access and fraud. Furthermore, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the data within the smart parking ecosystem and to improve authentication process, we propose the implementation of a tailored blockchain framework. This framework incorporates lightweight local blockchains dedicated to individual parking slots, complemented by a central blockchain that manages data at the city level. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the PUF computation process, showcasing an acceptable runtime for practical implementation. In the experimental results, we evaluated the SRAM used for the PUF implementation process and demonstrated its stability (intra HD equals to 2.25.},

According to Reuters, global car makers plan to invest over half a billion in more efficient and intelligent EVs and batteries. However, there are several challenges in EV mass production, including cybersecurity. Due to the cyber-physical nature of EVs and charging stations, their security and trustworthiness are ongoing challenges. In this study, we identify gaps in the security profiling of EVs and categorize them into five components: 1) charging station security, 2) information privacy, 3) software security, 4) connected vehicle security, and 5) autonomous driving security. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of identified vulnerabilities, threats, challenges and attacks for different EV security aspects, along with their possible surface/subsurface and countermeasures. We develop a comprehensive security risk assessment framework by first using EV security profiles and mapping identified vulnerabilities to a well-known threat model, STRIDE. Then, we classify the risk levels associated with each vulnerability by setting ground criteria for the impact and likelihood of the threats. Finally, we validate our risk assessment framework by applying the same criteria to eight real-world EV attack scenarios. As a result, researchers can adapt the proposed risk assessment framework to discover threats and assess their risks in EVs and charging station ecosystems.},

This nexus of EVs, EVCSs, and power grids creates complex cyber-physical interdependencies that can be maliciously exploited to damage each of these components. This paper describes and analyzes cyber vulnerabilities that arise at this nexus and points to the current and emerging gaps in the security of the EV charging ecosystem. These vulnerabilities must be addressed as the number of EVs continue to grow worldwide and their impact on the power grid becomes more viable. The purpose of this paper is to list and characterize all backdoors that can be exploited to seriously harm either EV and EVCS equipments, or power grid, or both.

	abstract     = {An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is a cyber physical system (CPS) that is well recognized due to its distinctive applications such as passenger safety, enhanced traffic efficiency, and infotainment services. However, very recently, these CPSs have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and the count is expected to increase significantly in the years to come. Under such scenarios, the conventional ITS solutions would fall short due to numerous technical limitations such as reduced flexibility, poor connectivity, limited scalability, and lack of adequate intelligence. In this direction, the cloud computing paradigm would also lag behind in meeting the following expected challenges: high mobility, minimal latency, realtime services, and high quality of service (QoS). Software defined networking (SDN) and edge computing (EC) are expected to be promising solutions for modern ITS. SDN allows efficient management of networks by virtue of its decoupled data and control planes. Moreover, EC is an extension of cloud computing that allows data processing, storage, and management at the edge of the network. Thus, these promising paradigms can address the network and data processing challenges of AV networks in rea time. Further, distributed mobility management (DMM) with improvised routing capabilities in the considered setup can bring added advantages in the form of zero tunneling overhead, full-fledged control of flow table entries, QoS-driven routing decisions, and efficient interplay between the edge and the cloud. Keeping in view the potential benefits of SDN, EC, and DMM in future AV networks, this work presents a composite framework with a distributed SDN-DMM approach in ITS ecosystems. Further, conventional DMM has been improved by stacking the Optimized Routing Decision module on it. This coupling yields a mobility-aware and QoS-driven (MobQoS) SDN framework for AVs that handles both the mobility and QoS challenges of the underlying vehicular networks. Additionally, it is also designed to handle the interplay between the edge and the cloud in an optimized manner using the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). Numerical comparisons depict that the proposed MobQoS outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of overall communication latency and bandwidth utilization. The performance assessment has been carried out using NS-3 and SUMO wherein an overall improvement of 15.95 percent has been reported in terms of end-to-end delay.},
