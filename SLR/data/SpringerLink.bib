  abstract  = "AbstractSuccessful engineering principles for building software
               systems rely on the separation of concerns for mastering
               complexity. However, just working on different concerns of a
               system in a collaborative way is not good enough for
               economically feasible tailored solutions. A successful approach
               for this is the composition of complex systems out of commodity
               building blocks. These come as is and can be represented as
               blocks with ports via data sheets. Data sheets are models and
               allow a proper selection and configuration as well as the
               prediction of the behavior of a building block in a specific
               context. This chapter explains how model-driven approaches can
               be used to support separation of roles and composition for
               robotics software systems. The models, open-source tools,
               open-source robotics software components and fully deployable
               robotics software systems shape a robotics software ecosystem.",

               on the computer of the 21st century. Over the years, some of the
               UbiComp features presented in that paper have been gradually
               adopted by industry players in the technology market. While this
               technological evolution resulted in many benefits to our

               that we have yet to surpass. In this paper, we address major
               challenges from areas that most afflict the UbiComp revolution:
               1.Software Protection: weakly typed languages, polyglot
               software, and networked embedded systems.2.Long-term Security:
               recent advances in cryptanalysis and quantum
               attacks.3.Cryptography Engineering: lightweight cryptosystems
               and their secure implementation.4.Resilience: issues related to
               service availability and the paramount role of
               resilience.5.Identity Management: requirements to identity
               management with invisibility.6.Privacy Implications: sensitivity
               data identification and regulation.7.Forensics: trustworthy
               evidence from the synergy of digital and physical world.We point
               out directions towards the solutions of those problems and claim
               that if we get all this right, we will turn the science fiction

               challenge for many organizations. After decades of research on
               variability management concepts, many industrial organizations
               have introduced techniques known from research, but still lament
               that pure textbook approaches are not applicable or efficient.
               For instance, software product line engineering---an approach to
               systematically develop portfolios of products---is difficult to
               adopt given the high upfront investments; and even when adopted,
               organizations are challenged by evolving their complex product
               lines. Consequently, the research community now mainly focuses
               on re-engineering and evolution techniques for product lines;
               yet, understanding the current state of adoption and the
               industrial challenges for organizations is necessary to conceive
               effective techniques. In this multiple-case study, we analyze
               the current adoption of variability management techniques in
               twelve medium- to large-scale industrial cases in domains such
               as automotive, aerospace or railway systems. We identify the
               current state of variability management, emphasizing the
               techniques and concepts they adopted. We elicit the needs and
               challenges expressed for these cases, triangulated with results
               from a literature review. We believe our results help to
               understand the current state of adoption and shed light on gaps
               to address in industrial practice.",

               a step change in the way the systems are developed and verified

  abstract  = "AbstractSoftware product line engineering is a best practice for
               managing reuse in families of software systems that is
               increasingly being applied to novel and emerging domains. In
               this work we investigate the use of software product line
               engineering in one of these new domains, synthetic biology. In
               synthetic biology living organisms are programmed to perform new
               functions or improve existing functions. These programs are
               designed and constructed using small building blocks made out of
               DNA. We conjecture that there are families of products that
               consist of common and variable DNA parts, and we can leverage
               product line engineering to help synthetic biologists build,
               evolve, and reuse DNA parts. In this paper we perform an
               investigation of domain engineering that leverages an
               open-source repository of more than 45,000 reusable DNA parts.
               We show the feasibility of these new types of product line
               models by identifying features and related artifacts in up to
               93.5\% of products, and that there is indeed both commonality
               and variability. We then construct feature models for four
               commonly engineered functions leading to product lines ranging
               from 10 to 7.5 $\times$ 1020 products. In a case study we
               demonstrate how we can use the feature models to help guide new
               experimentation in aspects of application engineering. Finally,
               in an empirical study we demonstrate the effectiveness and
               efficiency of automated reverse engineering on both complete and
               incomplete sets of products. In the process of these studies, we
               highlight key challenges and uncovered limitations of existing
               SPL techniques and tools which provide a roadmap for making SPL
               engineering applicable to new and emerging domains.",

  abstract  = "AbstractSoftware documentation is often neglected, impacting
               maintenance and reuse and leading to technical issues. In
               particular, when working with scientific software, such issues
               in the documentation pose a risk to producing reliable
               scientific results as they may cause improper or incorrect use
               of the software. R is a popular programming language for
               scientific software with a prolific package-based ecosystem,
               where users contribute packages (i.e., libraries). R packages
               are intended to be reused, and their users rely extensively on
               the available documentation. Thus, understanding what
               information developers provide in their packages' documentation
               (generally, through a system known as Roxygen, based on Javadoc)
               is essential to contribute to it. This study mined 379 GitHub
               repositories of R packages and analysed a sample to develop a
               taxonomy of natural language descriptions used in Roxygen
               documentation. This was done through hybrid card sorting, which
               included two experienced R developers. The resulting taxonomy
               covers parameters, returns, and descriptions, providing a
               baseline for further studies. Our taxonomy is the first of its
               kind for R. Based on previous studies in pure object-oriented
               languages, our taxonomy could be extensible to other
               dynamically-typed languages used in scientific programming.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Context Automotive software architectures describe
               distributed functionality by an interaction of software
               components. One drawback of today's architectures is their
               strong integration into the onboard communication network based
               on predefined dependencies at design time. The idea is to reduce
               this rigid integration and technological dependencies. To this
               end, service-oriented architecture offers a suitable methodology
               since network communication is dynamically established at
               run-time. Aim We target to provide a methodology for analysing
               hardware resources and synthesising automotive service-oriented
               architectures based on platform-independent service models.
               Subsequently, we focus on transforming these models into a
               platform-specific architecture realisation process following
               AUTOSAR Adaptive. Approach For the platform-independent part, we
               apply the concepts of design space exploration and simulation to
               analyse and synthesise deployment configurations, i. e., mapping
               services to hardware resources at an early development stage. We
               refine these configurations to AUTOSAR Adaptive software
               architecture models representing the necessary input for a
               subsequent implementation process for the platform-specific
               part. Result We present deployment configurations that are
               optimal for the usage of a given set of computing resources
               currently under consideration for our next generation of E/E
               architecture. We also provide simulation results that
               demonstrate the ability of these configurations to meet the run
               time requirements. Both results helped us to decide whether a
               particular configuration can be implemented. As a possible
               software toolchain for this purpose, we finally provide a
               prototype. Conclusion The use of models and their analysis are
               proper means to get there, but the quality and speed of
               development must also be considered.",

  abstract  = "AbstractEffective collaboration of embedded systems relies
               strongly on the assumption that all components of the system and
               the system itself operate as expected. A level of trust is
               established based on that assumption. To verify and validate
               these assumptions, we propose a systematic procedure that starts
               at the design phase and spans the runtime of the systems. At
               design time, we propose system evaluation in pure virtual
               environments, allowing multiple system behaviors to be executed
               in a variety of scenarios. At runtime, we suggest performing
               predictive simulation to get insights into the system's
               decisionmaking process. This enables trust to be created in the
               system part of a cooperation. When cooperation is performed in
               open, uncertain environments, the negotiation protocols between
               collaborative systems must be monitored at runtime. By engaging
               in various negotiation protocols, the participants assign roles,
               schedule tasks, and combine their world views to allow more
               resilient perception and planning. In this chapter, we describe
               two complementary monitoring approaches to address the
               decentralized nature of collaborative embedded systems.",

  abstract  = "AbstractGood data quality is crucial for any data-driven
               system's effective and safe operation. For critical safety
               systems, the significance of data quality is even higher since
               incorrect or low-quality data may cause fatal faults. However,
               there are challenges in identifying and managing data quality.
               In particular, there is no accepted process to define and
               continuously test data quality concerning what is necessary for
               operating the system. This lack is problematic because even
               safety-critical systems become increasingly dependent on data.
               Here, we propose a Candidate Framework for Data Quality
               Assessment and Maintenance (CaFDaQAM) to systematically manage
               data quality and related requirements based on design science
               research. The framework is constructed based on an advanced

               on empirical data from a literature review, focus groups, and
               design workshops. The proposed framework consists of four
               components: a Data Quality Workflow, a List of Data Quality

  abstract  = "Abstract Context Models, as the main artifact in model-driven
               engineering, have been extensively used in the area of embedded
               systems for code generation and verification. One of the most
               popular behavioral modeling techniques is the state machine.
               Many state machine modeling guidelines recommend that a state
               machine should have more than one state in order to be
               meaningful. However, single-state state machines (SSSMs)
               violating this recommendation have been used in modeling cases
               reported in the literature. Objective We aim for understanding
               the phenomenon of using SSSMs in practice as understanding why
               developers violate the modeling guidelines is the first step
               towards improvement of modeling tools and practice. Method To
               study the phenomenon, we conducted an exploratory study which
               consists of two complementary studies. The first study
               investigated the prevalence and role of SSSMs in the domain of
               embedded systems, as well as the reasons why developers use them
               and their perceived advantages and disadvantages. We employed
               the sequential explanatory strategy, including repository mining
               and interview, to study 1500 state machines from 26 components
               at ASML, a leading company in manufacturing lithography machines
               from the semiconductor industry. In the second study, we
               investigated the evolutionary aspects of SSSMs, exploring when
               SSSMs are introduced to the systems and how developers modify
               them by mining the largest state-machine-based component from
               the company. Results We observe that 25 out of 26 components
               contain SSSMs. Our interviews suggest that SSSMs are used to
               interface with the existing code, to deal with tool limitations,
               to facilitate maintenance and to ease verification. Our study on
               the evolutionary aspects of SSSMs reveals that the need for
               SSSMs to deal with tool limitations grew continuously over the
               years. Moreover, only a minority of SSSMs have been changed
               between SSSM and multiple-state state machine (MSSM) during
               their evolution. The most frequent modifications developers made
               to SSSMs is inserting events with constraints on the execution
               of the events. Conclusions Based on our results, we provide
               implications for developers and tool builders. Furthermore, we
               formulate hypotheses about the effectiveness of SSSMs, the
               impacts of SSSMs on development, maintenance and verification as
               well as the evolution of SSSMs.",

  abstract  = "AbstractMocking frameworks provide convenient APIs, which create
               mock objects, manipulate their behavior, and verify their
               execution, for the purpose of isolating test dependencies in
               unit testing. This study contributes an in-depth empirical study
               of whether and how mocking frameworks are used in Apache
               projects. The key findings and insights of this study include:
               First, mocking frameworks are widely used in 66\% of Apache Java
               projects, with Mockito, EasyMock, and PowerMock being the top
               three most popular frameworks. Larger-scale and more recent
               projects tend to observe a stronger need to use mocking
               frameworks. This underscores the importance of mocking in
               practice and related future research. Second, mocking is overall
               practiced quite selectively in software projects---not all test
               files use mocking, nor all dependencies of a test target are
               mocked. It calls for more future research to gain a more
               systematic understanding of when and what to mock to provide
               formal guidance to practitioners. On top of this, the intensity
               of mocking in different projects shows different trends in the
               projects' evolution history---implying the compound effects of
               various factors, such as the pace of a project's growth, the
               available resources, time pressure, and priority, etc. This
               points to an important future research direction in facilitating
               best mocking practices in software evolution. Furthermore, we
               revealed the most frequently used APIs in the three most popular
               frameworks, organized based on the function types. The top five
               APIs in each functional type of the three mocking frameworks
               usually take the majority (78\% to 100\%) of usage in Apache
               projects. This indicates that developers can focus on these APIs
               to quickly learn the common usage of these mocking frameworks.
               We further investigated informal methods of mocking, which do
               not rely on any mocking framework. These informal mocking
               methods point to potential sub-optimal mocking practices that
               could be improved, as well as limitations of existing mocking
               frameworks. Finally, we conducted a developer survey to collect
               additional insights regarding the above analysis based on their
               experience, which complements our analysis based on repository
               mining. Overall, this study offers practitioners profound
               empirical knowledge of how mocking frameworks are used in
               practice and sheds light on future research directions to
               enhancing mocking in practice.",

  abstract  = "AbstractThe development of new business models is essential for
               startups to become successful, as well as for established
               companies to explore new business opportunities. However,
               developing such business models is a continuous challenging
               activity where different tasks need to be performed, and
               business decisions need to be made. Both have to fit the
               constantly changeable situation in which the business model is
               developed to reduce the risk of developing ineffective business
               models with low market penetration. Therefore, a method for
               developing situation-specific business models is needed. As a
               solution, we refine the concept of situational method
               engineering (SME) to business model development. SME, in turn,
               provides means to construct situation-specific development
               methods out of fragments from a method repository. We develop a
               concept for the continuous situation-specific development of
               business models based on design science. The approach uses the
               roles of a domain expert, a method engineer, and a business
               developer together with a repository with method fragments for
               developing business models and a repository with modeling
               artifacts for supporting the development. Both repositories are
               filled by utilizing the experience of domain experts. Out of
               these repositories, situation-specific development methods for
               developing business models can be continuously composed based on
               the changeable situation by the method engineer and enacted by
               the business developer. We implement it as an open-source tool
               and evaluate its applicability in an industrial case study of
               developing a business model for a local event platform. Our
               results show that situation awareness supports the continuous
