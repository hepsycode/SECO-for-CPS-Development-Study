Sometimes this was very  slow, and we had no good process for this when the project started. Over time we built this process with information security workshops. We also published two open data sets in the project, and we used these in hackathons and also in collaborations. 
(2) When it comes to integrating solutions in our environment, it was difficult to know beforehand what parameters we should use -- how should data be partitioned for the results to be meaningful, etc.
(3) Staffing was sometimes tough. I could have easily put two developers and a PhD student to work full time for three years, but I did not get that kind of resources to work in the project, so prioritization was hard.","As I wrote in the previous answer, we had a challenge in getting data. This was resolved by anonymization and cleaning of data, as well as going through information security risk analysis workshops. 
When it comes to staffing we got better over time at allocating time to the project, but we also reduced our effort and gave some of our time to another partner.","I did not understand it at all at first, but over time I like it more and more. Now I think it's OK.",,,,"I think that requirements has helped us think about the common problem (in all of AIDOaRt) instead of just focusing on small problems. So it has been good for the project, and perhaps it has also helped somewhat with the quality as well.",,Not so much in my experience.,,"I don't think I was so involved in this, so I don't really know.",,"I know I cared a lot about the data formats, and the formalism in the data formats was helpful.",,"I think it will be hard to go back to the KPIs, but I guess it's helpful with the mapping.",,No,,Yes,"This required some work. The application was containerized and we had to standardize some interfaces, and clean up some code, so that part was relatively easy. We also made a small front-end to the tool so that we could look at results. The challenging part was to set parameters and how to partition data for it. I'm still not sure we did what is best here.",Yes,"I was quite skeptic of AI before AIDOaRt, but this tools have showed that it can be really helpful. With some more minor changes this tool could be used quite a bit among colleagues.","I had no experience at all of MDE before AIDOaRt. We did not plan to work on it. But we took the opportunity and now have a master student work on this for us. I hope to learn, and I hope that the company learns as well.","I only worked with RE for the project, and did not work with RE of our solutions. However, again we were opportunistic and will try to start a collaboration with RISE and MDU to look at some of our requirements and see if the have quality or ambiguities. This is under start-up, and hopefully we can participate with something before end of project.","This was at the core or our use case. We aim to speed up the DevOps phases by introducing AI tools. The experience is that we need very much data, it's a big pain to collect it, store it, and then parse it and format it. But when that is done, we can have great use of AI in the DevOps pipeline, in particular when it comes to analyzing results, similarities, etc. In other words, we start with AI that perceives (""there seems to be a problem""). We hope that we can also reach some experience of AI that predicts in AIDOaRt (""I think this will be a problem""). In some future project, perhaps we can get to an AI that will prescribe (""do this to avoid the coming problem"").","Everything we have done has been for automation. My experience is that the border between automation in general and AI-powered automation is not always very clear. Also, it seems that any automation needs to be monitored. E.g., is the process green because no problem was found or because the AI-application crashed and was unable to look for problems?","As I have written above, this was a big problem for us. We have a lot of company data, but when we wanted to share it with academic partners, decision-makers sometimes said no, and we had to put in a lot of time in cleaning data. In the end we also published two open data sets, and this made things a lot more easy.

Another problem was for data to never leave the office, colleagues were always paranoid that an AI application would live in some cloud server somewhere such that our data might have to travel far and leak.","I think this is a bit hard. I have been living in my own bubble for quite a bit, and focused very much on our use case - so I don't think I have a good answer to this question.","Perhaps there were too many partners? It's hard to see that we are all working on the same problem?

Also, as a use case provider, I don't really know if I should work in all work packages, or in just a few -- it seems we have been involved everywhere.","Yes absolutely. We became quite close to partners that were already close. In the first AIDOSec application we also had concrete plans on how we could collaborate with partners looking at things in AIDOaRt that we wanted to look at in AIDOaRt, e.g. fuzz testing.

Also, during AIDOaRt, we were opportunists and collaborated with partners we had not initially planned to work with. One factor for success was the Hackathons and open data. We asked some partners about a potential problem in an open data set, which led to some work in a Hackathon, and this later led to a publication that they drove, and an extension of one of their tools."

This was solved using generated data. (2) Integrating DevOps in vendor locked tool environment. This was solved using emerging standards for standalone models. (3) Communication and coordination in collaboration with several solution partners for one use case partner. This was solved by having joint weekly meetings. In this way, there was transparent collaboration and several internal collaborations could emerge and made communication more efficient.","See above. On a holistic level many minor issues can be attributed to the differences in expectations and goals in the project. With re-occuring meetings and transparent discussions this became less of an issue, e.g, partners being honest with what type of publication they would like to make upfront so there could be a discussion and planning OR that the use case partner was clear what kind of solutions would be interesting from start and assisted in tuning challenges to find a better match in case there was a misalignment. In essence, communication, transparency, and a willingness to compromise.","To me the figure makes sense, but I have a hard time placing it in terms of the collaboraiton I have been part of as a UCP.",,,,"I would not say it has helped in my case for the solutions/use case itself, BUT it has helped with reporting.",,"Not from my side, it has rarely been discussed.",,"Similar as above, it has helped with reporting, but not the actual colab/development.

",Neither good or bad.,"It has been interesting, but it has been hard to apply strictly. But the notion of DevOps has been very insightful for me personally and for the use case. ","I find they have been a bit rough. It has been difficult to find good applications even though we have had the ideas and data needed. I think it would require a more focused project or more extensive work to truly integrate AI well in the use cases I have participated in, which is a shame. ","This has been good, I feel that the data formats/standards have been the most important part of the project for all of the other pillars. In our use cases we have spent efforts in applying various standards and common platforms so that data can freely be exchanged between different components in our solution framework.",I have no real opinion on this.,"I would reduce scope. I would make the first hackathon more streamlined for UCP by requiring a set of specific inputs, E.g, examples/data/descriptions and so forth. At some point we did a mapping of UCs to solutions in terms of if they could be interesting for the UCs. I think that activity should be part of a first hackathon, so that already at that stage are UCs and solutions already defined for inputs/outputs. There has been a lot of time spent from the UC side to understand solution limitations/conditions AFTER we started colab. It would be good if that could be someway clear BEFORE. Mostly I think it has been a good avenue for collaboration, but from my side it could have started earlier with a bit more clarity from both UC and SP perspective early on.",Yes. Both internally and externally to the project. Since there has been so many interactions with different people in the project there has been many opportunities to find common problem or research directions through hackathon discussions or other discussions at plenary meetings.

Many solutions are academic tools with potential limitation to be discovered in challenging industrial settings. From a technical, modeld-driven perspective, the solution consists in identifying one or more common technological context/space (Ts). For JKU, this TS is the Eclipse Modeling Framework and related technologies, we worked on promoting the integration through EMF.

Challenge 2: Organizational challenges are pivotal. For the development and integration of solutions, the presence of stable teams is crucial. Typically, research outcomes from PhD students constitute the academic system and technical contributions in EU projects. Consequently, the development, utilization, and integration of such solutions are at a higher risk due to the transitory nature of these positions. While this issue is somewhat addressed at the project level, it invariably leads to complications in the medium to long term.

",See the answer to the previous question,3,3,3,"Is the AIDOaRt architecture clear and understandable? (e.g., all components are well described) : From a design-level perspective, it is understandable, given my previous knowledge of UML. 

Is the AIDOaRt architecture easy to use and explore? (e.g., easy to relate your UC requirements or solutions to the architecture components). Modelio helps in surfing the information. However, given the nature of the AIDOaRt framework as a collection of existing/extended solutions, the overall architecture and related documentation is only descriptive and can be subject to erosion when changes will come after the end on the project 

Do you believe the architecture can be easily extended or used outside the scope of the AIDOaRt project? AIDOaRt is an extensive framework encompassing numerous solutions. I anticipate that an expansion could apply to a subset of the AIDOaRt solutions that have contributed to resolving a specific use case. However, it is improbable that an expansion would pertain to the entire AIDOaRt project.

More specifically, in the RDE use case of AVL we were challenged by the fact that only a small number of (albeit long) data traces is available. This is a case in which the performance of learning algorithms such as IOAlergia deteriorates. To overcome this problem, we developed a novel method that uses domain knowledge to split the learning problem into smaller problems with more but shorter data traces. This is done in a way that allows recombining the solutions of the sub problems into a solution for the overall problem.

A common challenge related to the use and integration of active automata learning is developing a suitable abstraction of the system under learning (SUL). Such an abstraction needs to be weak enough to cover interesting behavior while being strong enough to keep learning tractable by avoiding redundant exploration of similar and uninteresting behaviors. This also applies to the MBT use case of AVL in which we model the behavior of an Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) in response to changes of the environment. In this case the abstraction has to avoid violations of the operational domain of the ADAS function, including safety violations caused by environment-controlled vehicles. This was achieved by encoding domain constraints and caching violations. This also requires interaction with the simulation environment, which is a non-negligible engineering effort.",,3,2,3,"It appears to me, that the granularity of the AIDOaRt framework is not overly consistent. At times it is extremely abstract while other aspects are covered in much more detail.

We sometimes rereported things that were either already present in Modelio or where the data in Modelio could have served as a baseline.

We believed this is a key result and tried to instantiate it earlier -- we pushed for it quite hard during the production of D5.2 but it wasn't agreed to be produced at that stage.,"The project maybe has felt a bit like 'islands of research' rather than a unified effort. This approach is useful because you let the teams work at their own pace and generate interesting detailed results, but maybe a separate track to produce a 'AIDOaRt integrated prototype' that encapsulated a bit more comprehensively the results, integrating efforts from several of these 'islands' could have been useful. Even if it was solving a quite artificial problem it could have been an exemplary result that made easier to understand what is AIDOaRt as a whole.","We produced a useful collaboration with MDU in the last Hackathon in Linz that we could take further, using generative AI to produce requirements for NLP model training.

These challenges were addressed through a collaboration with UCPs and SPs, while the accuracy was assessed through targeted tests and benchmarks aimed at improving the tool's performance and estimations.","Issues were encountered while using the tool by UCP, which were resolved through live tutorials and dedicated workshops to explain the steps and implementation of the tool in detail, and by improving the documentation related to the tool.",5,5,5,"The AIDOaRt architecture is clear and understandable, the components are well described, it is easy to explore and use, especially using the MODELIO tool, and it could be extended by considering, for example, security issues.",4,"There might be room for improvement in areas like architecture exmplainability and accountability, and the mapping between the AIDOaRt architecture and possible ""example"" implemented components",3,"By visualizing how solutions and requirements map to the same components, we can see potential overlap and collaboration opportunities more easily compared to searching through a vast set of solutions and requirements independently with serendipity.

However, it may be beneficial to explore ways to further enhance collaboration discovery. For example, implementing a specific tool or process to analyze the mappings and suggest potential collaborations could be valuable.",4," There are some areas where the process could be improved. Firstly, the documentation of the process could be more comprehensive. Secondly, the process could be further improved by developing specific tools to support its activities",4,"While formalization/definition helps, it's valuable to revisit and refine requirements, capabilities, and interfaces throughout the project lifecycle to ensure they remain relevant and achievable.",4,The use of dedicated requirements mapping tools could streamline the process and make it more efficient.,Yes,"Developing our solutiopn (HEPSYCODE) has been a valuable learning experience. The AIDOaRt iterative architecting process helped establish a clear and well-documented architecture for the HEPSYCODE solution. The process also facilitated communication and collaboration between different development teams.

The emphasis on collecting requirements, defining KPIs, and mapping them to solutions helped ensure the HEPSYCODE solution addressed the intended needs and delivered measurable value. the whole AIDOaRt approach allows to minimize rework and to ensure all components aligned with the overall goals. The AIDOaRt process provided a solid foundation, but ongoing improvement can make it even more effective for future projects.",Yes,"My experiences integrating the solution have been moderately positive. There have been both successes and challenges to navigate. Setting up the initial configuration required some effort, and there could be room for improvement in the onboarding materials. We encountered a few minor compatibility issues with our existing systems, which required some troubleshooting. Overall, the integration process was manageable. ",Yes,"We integrated our existing workflows in MORGAN (UNIVAQ) and process.mining (JKU). By analyzing model tracing data, we were able to help desingers in the continuous HEPSYCODE modeling activities. Automation and fully-integration is still an ongoing work.","My experiences working with Modeling and MDE in AIDOaRt have been generally positive, but there could be improvement. The use of models facilitated better communication and collaboration between different teams involved in AIDOaRt. A shared understanding of the system through models helped to align efforts and reduce misunderstandings. Moreover, MDE practices encouraged a more structured and rigorous approach to system design. This led to a clearer definition of requirements, components, and their interactions, potentially improving the overall design quality. Furthermore, models act as a form of documentation, providing a visual representation of the system. This can improve traceability between requirements, design decisions, and implementation, aiding in future maintenance and updates. 

While some MDE tools were used, there could be further exploration and adoption of specialized tools to streamline modeling activities and make them more efficient. Additionally, providing more comprehensive training on MDE best practices for all stakeholders could improve overall effectiveness. Another problem could be when the complexity of the system increases, where managing large and intricate models can become challenging. Strategies for model modularization and version control could be further refined to ensure clarity and maintainability.
Finally, integrating MDE practices effectively with existing development workflows could be further optimized. Streamlining the transition between modeling activities and coding phases could improve overall efficiency.
