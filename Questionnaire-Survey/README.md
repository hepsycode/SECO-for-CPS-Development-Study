## Solutions (Tools) Development

Feedback regarding the development and application of the AIDOaRt tools:

2. **In which domain(s) are you applying or developing solutions?**
3. **Main achievements on the project level for your solutions?**
4. **Can you describe one to three key challenges you have overcome in developing, using, or integrating the solutions? How did you overcome them?**
5. **Can you describe the issues you encountered, if any? How did you overcome them, if so?**

## AIDOaRt SECO Architecture

Benefits obtained from the AIDOaRt SECO architecture and the SECO architectural design process adopted:

1. **Is the AIDOaRt SECO architecture clear and understandable?** (e.g., all components are well described)
2. **Is the AIDOaRt SECO architecture easy to use and explore?** (e.g., easy to relate your UC requirements or solutions to the architecture components)
3. **Do you believe the architecture can be easily extended or used outside the scope of the AIDOaRt project?**
4. **Please, provide any justifications about the previous answers, and any comments or suggestions about the architecture.**
5. **Has the way we organized the architecture helped ensure quality in your solutions/use cases developed?** (e.g., collecting requirements and KPI, and mapping requirements, solutions, and components)
6. **Did the mapping collected within the architecture help identify potential collaborations?** (i.e., looking for solutions/requirements mapped to the same architecture components instead of an exhaustive search across the large set of solutions and requirements)
7. **To design the AIDOaRt SECO architecture, we followed an incremental approach (inspired by DevOps), the specification of the requirements and the main components were first collected/defined and then iteratively refined following the tools and use cases development phase. Has the AIDOaRt SECO iterative architecting process helped to provide quality in the implemented solutions/tools?**
8. **Any comment on the previous question?**
9. **Did formalizing/defining the requirements and capabilities/interfaces help define the scope of the solution?**
10. **Any comment on the previous question?**
11. **Was it helpful to have requirements mapping to achieve desired outcomes (e.g., KPIs)?**
12. **Any comment on the previous question?**
