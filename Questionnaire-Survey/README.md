## Solutions (Tools) Development

Feedback regarding the development and application of the AIDOaRt tools:

- **B.5** Can you describe the issues you encountered, if any? How did you overcome them, if so?

## AIDOaRt SECO Architecture

Benefits obtained from the AIDOaRt SECO architecture and the SECO architectural design process adopted:

- **C.1** Is the AIDOaRt SECO architecture clear and understandable? (e.g., all components are well described)
- **C.2** Is the AIDOaRt SECO architecture easy to use and explore? (e.g., easy to relate your UC requirements or solutions to the architecture components)
- **C.3** Do you believe the architecture can be easily extended or used outside the scope of the AIDOaRt project?
- **C.4** Please, provide any justifications about the previous answers, and any comments or suggestions about the architecture.
- **C.5** Has the way we organized the architecture helped ensure quality in your solutions/use cases developed? (e.g., collecting requirements and KPI, and mapping requirements, solutions, and components)
- **C.6** Did the mapping collected within the architecture help identify potential collaborations? (i.e., looking for solutions/requirements mapped to the same architecture components instead of an exhaustive search across the large set of solutions and requirements)
- **C.7** To design the AIDOaRt SECO architecture, we followed an incremental approach (inspired by DevOps), the specification of the requirements and the main components were first collected/defined and then iteratively refined following the tools and use cases development phase. Has the AIDOaRt SECO iterative architecting process helped to provide quality in the implemented solutions/tools?
- **C.8** Any comment on the previous question?
- **C.9** Did formalizing/defining the requirements and capabilities/interfaces help define the scope of the solution?
- **C.10** Any comment on the previous question?
- **C.11** Was it helpful to have requirements mapping to achieve desired outcomes (e.g., KPIs)?
- **C.12** Any comment on the previous question?
