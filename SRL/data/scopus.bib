	abstract = {Many technological innovations from the research area of dynamic adaptive systems or IT ecosystems are already established in current software systems. Especially cyber-physical systems should benefit by this progress to provide smart applications in ambient environments of private and industrial space. But a proper and methodical engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems (CPES) is still an open and important issue. Traditional software and systems engineering facilities (system models, description languages, or process models) do not consider fundamental characteristics of these ecosystems as openness, uncertainty, or emergent constitution at runtime sufficiently. But especially these aspects let blur the line of system boundaries at design time. The diverse components of CPES have essential impacts on the engineering of CPES as well, concerning time synchronizing, execution control, and interaction structure. Self-balanced control in CPES promises new application possibilities, but also needs new engineering techniques concerning the overall engineering process, including requirements engineering and runtime verification. In this position paper we survey and summarize the dimensions of challenges in applying control theory for the engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The innovation of software ecosystems has great influences on the production style of IT industry. It refactors the business ecosystems of IT industry. Academic and industry researchers have paid close attention to software ecosystems since 2003. Some world-wide famous IT companies make efforts towards achieving their own software ecosystems. As has developed to numerous examples of software ecosystems. Currently, emerging information technologies (such as cloud computing, mobile application development, cyber-physical systems, blockchains) are applied deeply and widely in the field of software ecosystems. The application of software ecosystems has become more and more intensive in various industries and domains. The definition of a software ecosystem has changed greatly over time. In order to clarify the context of a software ecosystem, researchers adopt biological ecosystem theories, and propose several different kinds of definitions for software ecosystems. It is not until the year of 2016 that there is consensus on what a software ecosystem is. A software ecosystem refers to a complex system in which the software and its related stakeholders interact intensively within a common technological infrastructure. In the paper, we adopt biological ecosystem theories to the context so as to come out a meta-model of software ecosystems which forms the basis for the discussion of the issues relating to software ecosystems. The meta-model, which is presented in UML class diagram, describes the key building blocks and key characteristics of software ecosystems. Typically, the research results of papers in the field of software ecosystems are compared to traditional classification which was presented in 2003. The traditional classification includes seven categories: (1) procedure or technique; (2) qualitative or descriptive model; (3) analytic model; (4) empirical model; (5) tool or notation; (6) specific solution, prototype, answer, or judgment; (7) report. But, the traditional classification schema has to be revised because that the context and the key characteristics of software ecosystems have changed greatly over time. According to our observations, we find that the combination of quantity and quality analysis is always adopted in the field, and that empirical studies reporting specific solutions for software ecosystems are in fashion. We make minor changes to the traditional classification schema for the papers focusing on software ecosystems, and then propose a five-classification pattern. Our five-classification schema combines "qualitative or descriptive model" and "analytic model" to produce a new category namely "analytic method or framework", and integrate "specific solution, prototype, answer, or judgment" into "empirical study". The meta-model as well as the five-classification schema forms the basis for the discussions of the issues relating to software ecosystems. Then, we provide a literal review of the research in the filed from 2015 until 2017. In total, the literature counts 196 papers. Our literature review is based on the keywords, the abstract, publication source, research content. We category the research results of papers into our five-category schema, and then identify the recent development and progress in the field. However, there exists a set of challenges for future research. Those challenges includes requirements engineering, architecture modeling, model-driven development, power mechanisms, feature analysis, information content analysis, ecologic network analysis, impact analysis of defect and/or bad smell, tool supports, emerging applications for software ecosystems. © 2020, Science Press.

	abstract = {The adoption of Cyber Physical System (CPS) technologies at European level is constrained by a still emerging value chain and by the challenging transformation of manufacturing processes and business ecosystems that their deployment requires. This issue becomes even more challenging when the concept of CPS is exploited to propose cyber-physical machines and manufacturing systems, where the complexity of the controlling intelligence and of the digital counterpart explodes. As a matter of fact, the market behind CPS has a potential that is still scarcely supported by methodologies and tools able to foster the rise of a solid ecosystem required for a relevant market uptake. Multi-sided platforms (MSPs) have demonstrated to play the pivotal role of providing the environments and the technological infrastructures able to match make the needs of manifold user insisting on them. The manufacturing sector did not remain untouched by this trend and moves its first step towards the integration of platform logics across value networks: the CPS business ecosystem is one of those. In this chapter, beyond an analysis of the current state of the automation value network, the design and implementation of a multi-sided platform for CPS deployment within the automation sector are described. The proposed platform can provide the infrastructure to incentivize CPS adoption, creating the technological and value drivers supporting the transition towards new paradigms for the development of the software components of a mechatronic system. Developing an infrastructure on the top of which the CPS value network can be instantiated and orchestrated, the proposed platform provides the technical means to incentivize the creation of an ecosystem able to support especially SMEs in their transition towards Industry 4.0. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019.},
