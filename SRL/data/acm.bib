abstract = {It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 8th ACM International Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD'09). This volume comprises the final versions of the research and industry papers presented at the AOSD'09 conference held in Charlottesville, Virginia (USA), March 2-6, 2009. The proceedings also contain the abstracts of the keynote presentations. AOSD'09 is the eighth edition in a series of annual AOSD conferences. The series started in 2002 in Enschede (The Netherlands), followed by Boston, Massachusetts (USA) in 2003, Lancaster (UK) in 2004, Chicago, Illinois (USA) in 2005, Bonn (Germany) in 2006, Vancouver (Canada) in 2007, Brussels (Belgium) in 2008, and now Charlottesville, Virginia (USA) in 2009.This year's conference continues the tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research and industry results on leading-edge issues in aspect-oriented software development. The theme of this edition, Modularity Across the Software Ecosystem, was chosen to reflect the remarkable growth in scale and complexity of the systems now being developed, where modularity and abstraction are essential, not only in code, but across many kinds of software artifacts, systems, and indeed the whole software ecosystems. Although the central influence of the first editions of the conference was on programming languages and their use, the focus has been broadening to include other activities of software and systems development, such as software and systems specification, architecture, and adaptation. This year, an effort was made to emphasize architecture design, requirements analysis and engineering, aspect modeling, tests, and processes. Thus, the mission of this edition is to fulfill the needs of heterogeneous applications and environments, and to identify new directions for future research and development. AOSD'09 gives academia and industry a unique opportunity to share perspectives with others who are interested in the various forms of modularity and abstraction.The conference program reflects the balance between research and practice with a mix of research papers, reports from industry, student events, an industrial panel, birds of a feather sessions, and demonstrations. The six workshops held before the start of the conference reflect the breadth of topics of interest to the AOSD community. In addition to the presentation of research and industry papers across seven sessions, the technical program of AOSD'09 includes three keynotes talks: The Future of Software Architectures For Large-Scale Business Solutions: Modularity, Scalability, and Separation Of Concerns by Paul Daugherty, Cyber Physical Systems: Aspects as a Basis for Robustness and Openness by John A. Stankovic, and Everyday Aspects by Gail Murphy. These keynote talks represent, respectively, sophisticated views from the enterprise computing industry, computer systems research, and from the AOSD research community itself.The call for research papers for AOSD'09 elicited 86 abstracts from the international community, of which 68 were realized as full papers. Each research paper was reviewed by at least three referees, in most cases by four. All papers co-authored by Program Committee (PC) members were reviewed by at least five referees. Based on the reviews, the whole PC discussed the submissions' quality, leading to the selection of 19 research papers for presentation as part of the technical program. In previous AOSD editions, the PC discussions occurred during a physical meeting attended by all PC members. Due to the unforeseen global economic crisis of 2008 and 2009, and rising environmental concerns, the AOSD'09 research papers were discussed among the PC members through teleconferencing and online forums.This volume of AOSD'09 also includes four industrial papers advanced from the Industrial Track submissions. Representing the evolution in the industrial adoption of aspect-oriented technologies, these papers characterize the diversity and value in commercial application. The Industrial Track provides the opportunity to observe the introduction of a resonating technology to the ever present challenge of scale and complexity in a highly constrained world. To further discover challenges with industrial adoption, the paper presentations are partnered with an Industrial Panel to interactively dissect the challenges to quicken the pace to further industrial success stories.},

abstract = {In this work we tackle the problem of designing and developing software-intensive cyber-physical systems (CPS), which are large distributed systems of collaborating elements that closely interact with the physical world, such as intelligent transportation systems and crowdsourcing applications. Due to their specific constraints, such as extreme dynamism and continuous evolution of the physical substratum, and requirements, such us open-endedness and adaptability, CPS introduce many new challenges for software engineering. In response, we present a tailored ecosystem of software engineering models, methods, and tools. This ecosystem is centered on the DEECo component model, which we have proposed specifically for architecting software-intensive CPS.},

abstract = {Many technological innovations from the research area of dynamic adaptive systems or IT ecosystems are already established in current software systems. Especially cyber-physical systems should benefit by this progress to provide smart applications in ambient environments of private and industrial space. But a proper and methodical engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems (CPES) is still an open and important issue. Traditional software and systems engineering facilities (system models, description languages, or process models) do not consider fundamental characteristics of these ecosystems as openness, uncertainty, or emergent constitution at runtime sufficiently. But especially these aspects let blur the line of system boundaries at design time. The diverse components of CPES have essential impacts on the engineering of CPES as well, concerning time synchronizing, execution control, and interaction structure. Self-balanced control in CPES promises new application possibilities, but also needs new engineering techniques concerning the overall engineering process, including requirements engineering and runtime verification. In this position paper we survey and summarize the dimensions of challenges in applying control theory for the engineering of cyber-physical ecosystems.},

abstract = {Context: the Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that provides an ecosystem for a fast-growing quantity of connected devices, also defined as cyber-physical devices. Problem: the creation of Internet of Things solutions is fairly complex, having to integrate and communicate between sensors, devices, and larger systems, presenting many technical challenges not present in the same magnitude as other paradigms. One of the most affected segments is the development of cyber-physical devices. Much of its development energy is spent on the connecting and efficacy of these devices, often overlooking the future impacts of the proposed solution, caused by a lack of software quality. SI Theory: this work was designed under the Design Theory, currently found in the Justify/Evaluate stage’s refinement process. Methodology: model-driven development (MDD), a software development methodology that allows the generation of software solutions through abstract models, which aims to facilitate development, bringing the abstract solution closer to the problem’s implementation. In this work, a custom MDD approach for cyber-physical devices is presented. Results: the proposed approach and tool were able to generate C++ source code for Arduino devices, the generated source code performed better than control when compared using OOP specific software metrics. Contributions: this study presents an MDD approach for cyber-physical devices, where the innovative models are based and coupled to the hardware specifications, being extensible and flexible.},

Solution: The execution of a Systematic Mapping in order to bring attention to possible research gaps. SI Theory: This work follows the accepted protocols for systematic mappings, meta-analysis, and Hermeneutics. Methodology: this paper executes a systematic mapping, following well-accepted guidelines in order to systematically gather, include and classify scientific papers according to IoT devices’ own characteristics. Results: 8146 studies were found and reduced to 211 relevant studies that focused on client-side IoT development had their data graphed and analyzed. Our results show a lack of software metrics used, many research gaps and correlations were discovered, when in respect to specific software quality properties as described by the ISO25010 and other characteristics collected, such as programming languages and study domain. Contributions: The main contribution of this study is to expose multiple research gaps present in IoT client-side development. Providing a background for future information system studies on techniques and tools to improve IoT development.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is a coordinated push for automation in Smart Factories and other Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The increasing complexity of frequently changing production environments challenges shop floor workers to perform well. The tasks they work on are getting less routine and ask for continuous knowledge and skills development. For example, the skills portfolio of workers likely requires improved higher-order thinking and decision-making skills. A wide range of research and development efforts already today sets focus on different areas of workplace learning, including performance appraisals, pedagogy and education, technology, and business economics. Bridging the skills gap, however, requires novel user-facing technologies -- such as Augmented Reality (AR) and wearables -- for human performance augmentation to improve efficiency and effectiveness of staff delivered through live guidance. AR branches out beyond mobile apps with 3D-object superimposition for marketing purposes to rather complex use cases delivered by a rapidly growing innovation ecosystem of hard- and software providers collaborating closely with R&amp;D organisations. This paper provides a first shared vision on how AR can tackle four different challenges related to handling complexity in a CPS environment: develop intelligent assistance systems for learning and performance assessment at the workplace, adapt job profiles accordingly, and last but not least to address also the issue of work-life balance. The paper concludes with an outline of a research roadmap.},

abstract = {Welcome to GREENS 2016, the 5th ACM/IEEE International Workshop on Green and Sustainable Software on May 16, 2016 in Austin, Texas, USA. GREENS 2016 is co-located with the 38th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2016).WOne of the grand challenges for the next decade is to develop software engineering and control mechanisms and techniques for the long-term operation of cyber physical systems (CPS) using green sources of energy. While research results exist in measuring and controlling the level of greenness of hardware components, research is needed to relate energy consumption to executing software and entire cyber physical ecosystems. In the age of context, we can sense and monitor continuously context changes, perform analytics in the cloud, and then actuate physical components according to the computed findings---all from the palm of our hand. While researchers continue to innovate in the realm of CPS, we need to make the feedback loops more sustainable by minimizing energy consumption in its supported processes and decreasing its environmental impact---sensors, monitors, analyzers, planners, actuators, networks, controllers, applications and services. With monitoring in place, we have the opportunity for adaptive control to facilitate greening dynamically. We need to investigate engineering methods to aid engineers with CPS sustainability capabilities. Demonstrating green improvement while still controlling physical components is a key challenge. Showing CPS use, habits, or lifestyles can effectively decrease the energy footprint is the ultimate goal.},

We performed an online survey of software engineers with software integration experiences to identify the main difficulties of performing interoperability analysis. The results confirm that the state of available practical support and current input artifacts used during the analysis are significantly perceived as important difficulties. Respondents claim a lack of guidelines and best practices for applying interoperability analysis and claim insufficiency of shared information about interoperable software units. This indicates the need for providing directive and rigorous guidelines for practitioners to follow and to enrich the content of shared documents about interoperable software units.},

abstract = {In 2006, Ultra-Large-Scale Systems: The Software Challenge of the Future (ISBN 0-9786956-0-7) documented the results of a year-long study on ultra-large, complex, distributed systems. Ultra-large-scale (ULS) systems are socio-technical ecosystems of ultra-large size on one or many dimensions number of lines of code; number of people employing the system for different purposes; amount of data stored, accessed, manipulated, and refined; number of connections and interdependencies among software components; number of hardware elements to which they interface. The characteristics of such systems require changes in traditional software development and management practices, which in turn require a new multi-disciplinary perspective and research. A carefully prescribed research agenda was suggested. What has happened since the study results were published? This talk shares a perspective on the post study reality --- a perspective based on research motivated by the study and direct experiences with ULS systems. Linda Northrop is director of the Research, Technology, and Systems Solution Program at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) where she leads the work in architecture-centric engineering, software product lines, cyber-physical systems, advanced mobile systems, and ultra-large-scale systems. Linda is coauthor of the book Software Product Lines: Practices and Patterns and led the research group on ultra-large-scale systems that resulted in the book, Ultra-Large-Scale Systems: The Software Challenge of the Future. Before joining the SEI, she was associated with both the United States Air Force Academy and the State University of New York as professor of computer science, and with both Eastman Kodak and IBM as a software engineer. She is an SEI Fellow and an ACM Distinguished Member.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are "engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computational and physical components". With the proliferation of smart embedded and mobile devices, CPS are becoming large-scale pervasive systems, which combine various data sources to control real-world ecosystems (e.g., intelligent traffic control, smart manufacturing). Modern CPS have to deal effectively with environment dynamicity, control their emergent behavior, be scalable and tolerant to threats, hence CPS have to be smart (sCPS). sCPS feature a number of specifics that render traditional software engineering approaches not directly applicable. This calls for innovative approaches that jointly reflect and address the specifics of such systems.SEsCPS aims to bring together academics and practitioners from several disciplines with the overall objectives: (i) to increase the understanding of problems of Software Engineering (SE) for sCPS, (ii) to study the underlying foundational principles for engineering sCPS, and (iii) to identify and define promising SE solutions for sCPS. The special themes of SEsCPS 2017 are: (1) model-based engineering of secure, reliable and resilient sCPS, (2) engineering processes for sCPS, and (3) consequences of smartness of CPS and emergence in system of systems context. The full list of topics can be found on the workshop website.The workshop will be highly interactive, involving participants with and without accepted paper. After the workshop, we will consolidate the results from the workshop and prepare a joint report to be submitted to Software Engineering Notes. A formal follow-up publication will be considered in which interested attendees can be involved.},
